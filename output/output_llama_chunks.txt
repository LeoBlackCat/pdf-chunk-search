For this reason it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the entire operatic repertory. Armed with the knowledge of opera gained from this course, however, the listener will be able to explore in greater depth the extraordinary and compelling world of opera for himself or herself.
The listener will come to appreciate how music has the power to reveal truths beyond the spoken word; how opera is a unique marriage of words and music in which the whole is far greater than its parts. He or she will learn the reasons for opera’s enduring popularity.The history of opera is traced from its beginning in the early seventeenth century to around 1924, with references to landmark operas, musical, cultural, and social developments, and historical events that influenced opera’s growth. We learn how operatic style and form have changed continuously throughout the history of European music, as they were influenced by political, social and cultural developments, and how different national languages and cultures have shaped their own types of opera and operatic style.
The course opens with one of the most powerful moments in opera: the dramatically loaded aria “Nessun dorma” (“No one shall sleep”) from Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot. We are exposed to opera’s unique incorporation of soliloquy, dialogue, scenery, action, and continuous music into an incredibly expressive and exciting whole that is far greater than the sum of its parts. This famous aria shows us the power of the composer in creating music that goes beyond the words of the libretto to evoke unspoken thoughts and feelings-that which cannot be said in words alone. The study continues with a discussion of how music can flesh out a dramatic character and evoke the unconscious state. We are introduced to operatic archetypes such as Figaro and Carmen.
We are introduced to operatic archetypes such as Figaro and Carmen. We learn that the ancient Greeks revered music as a microcosm of all creation, believing music can change the Scope 2 face of nature and alter souls. The monophonic and, later, polyphonic music of the Middle Ages is examined. We see how the end of the absolute authority of the Roman Church encouraged the rise of secular and instrumental music. We examine the Renaissance, its rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman culture and the evolution of the madrigal, ultimately rejected in favor of a more expressive vocal medium: early opera. The renaissance intermezzo is discussed as the precursor of modern opera. The reforms of the Florentine Camerata are examined as they relate to the earliest operas.
The reforms of the Florentine Camerata are examined as they relate to the earliest operas. Part I of the course concludes with an analysis of the first successful attempt to combine words and music into musical drama, Monteverdi’s Orfeo of 1607. In Part II we see how recitative, the essence of Monteverdi’s style, made music subservient to words and how, because of its forward-driving nature, recitative cannot express personal reflection. We learn how the invention of aria gave opera composers a powerful tool to stop the dramatic action for moments of self-reflection. Gluck’s reforms and his Orfeo ed Euridice of 1762 are addressed as the starting point for the modern opera repertory.
Gluck’s reforms and his Orfeo ed Euridice of 1762 are addressed as the starting point for the modern opera repertory. The explosion of operas in the Golden Age/Dark Age of opera is discussed, along with the formulaic reforms of Pietro Metastasio (including his da capo structure for arias) and the vocal abuses that those reforms provoked. We learn how different voice types are assigned different roles. The rise of opera seria and its characteristics are discussed, along with an analysis of the second act of Mozart’s Idomeneo-opera seria transcendent. The second part of this study continues with the development of opera buffa, from its origins in the popular folklore of the commedia dell’arte to its eventual replacement of opera seria.
The role of Enlightenment progressives in this development is addressed and Mozart’s brilliant The Marriage of Figaro is discussed as one of the greatest contributions to the opera buffa genre. Part III opens with a discussion of the bel canto style of opera. We see how the nature of the Italian language and culture gave rise to this type of opera, with its comic, predictable plots, one-dimensional characters, appealing melodies, and florid melodic embellishments. The highly pressurized business of opera in the 18th century is revealed, and we are introduced to Rossini’s The Barber of Seville of 1816 as the quintessential bel canto opera. 3 Giuseppe Verdi is the focus of Lectures 19 through 22 of Part III. His career is summarized, and his operatic inheritance is reviewed.
His career is summarized, and his operatic inheritance is reviewed. We learn how Verdi broke the bel canto mold; how he dominated Italian opera for over half a century by virtue of his lyricism, his emphasis on human emotions and psychological insight, and his use of the orchestra and parlante to drive the dramatic action and maintain musical continuity. Verdi’s Otello is discussed as one of the greatest operas of all time. Part III of this course concludes with an examination of French opera. We learn how it developed as a distinctly different genre from Italian opera, shaped as it was by the French language, culture and political history. We learn how Jean-Baptiste Lully set the foundation for a French language operatic tradition, and how his greatest contribution was the design of a recitative style suited to the French language.
The reforms of JeanPhilippe Rameau are discussed, along with the influence of Enlightenment progressives such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who championed a more natural operatic style. Christoph Willibald von Gluck’s position as the model for the next generation of French composers is reviewed. Finally, the subject of 19th-century French opera is addressed. Grand opera, opéra comique and lyric opera are examined as distinctive French genres and Act Two of Bizet’s dramatically powerful Carmen is analyzed. Part IV opens with an examination of the rise of German opera, with its roots in German folklore. We discover how German singspiel grew from humble origins as a lower class entertainment to high art with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Rescue from the Harem (1782) and The Magic Flute of 1791.
We learn how 19th-century German opera grew out of the tradition of singspiel and how Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz established 19th-century German opera. The discussion of German opera continues with an examination of Richard Wagner: the man, his personal beliefs, musical theories, and operatic innovations. We see how Wagner went back to the ancient Greek ideal for inspiration and how he conceived the idea of an all-encompassing art work, or music drama, in which the role of the orchestra is that of a purveyor of unspoken truths. We are introduced to Wagner’s concept of leitmotif and his revolutionary use of dissonance. Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde is discussed as Scope 4 the most influential composition of the 19th century, aside from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.
The subject of late romantic German opera is addressed and exemplified by Richard Strauss and his controversial opera Salome. We go on to an overview of Russian opera and the concept of nationalism. The late development of Russian opera is outlined from Mikhail Glinka’s Ruslan and Lyudmila to Modest Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov. We see how the Russian language shaped the syllabic vocal style of Russian opera and how Russian rhythms, with their asymmetrical groupings of accents, are distinct from Italian, German and French rhythms. The course draws to its conclusion with an overview of opera verismo, a 19th/20th century genre that favors depictions of the darker side of the human condition. The pivotal second act of Giacomo Puccini’s Tosca is discussed as a transcendent example of opera verismo.
The pivotal second act of Giacomo Puccini’s Tosca is discussed as a transcendent example of opera verismo. Finally, we hear part of a scene from Richard Strauss’s Capriccio in which the essence of opera is debated. Is it words or is it music? It is neither. It is an indefinable combination of both, with the whole greater than the parts. ■ 5 Introduction and Words and Music Lectures 1 and 2 Lectures 1 through 4 [of this course] are conceived of as a large introductory set, consisting of three separate parts.... Part I... is a general introduction to and definition of opera.... Part II... is a presentation I call “Words and Music.”... The third part... is a brief but extremely intense history of expression in vocal music.
W e will begin our consideration of opera by examining Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot (1924). The scene is set in the city of Beijing in ancient China. Turandot, the daughter of the Chinese emperor, has promised to marry the man who can solve three riddles. So far no one has succeeded in answering these riddles. Calaf, the young Tartar prince, falls in love at first sight with Turandot and promptly announces his challenge to the riddles. He solves the riddles and then volunteers that if Turandot can discover his name before dawn, she will be freed from her vow to marry him and he will die. Turandot commands that no one shall sleep until the stranger’s name and identity are discovered.
Turandot commands that no one shall sleep until the stranger’s name and identity are discovered. Calaf sings a magnificent aria reflecting his love for Turandot and his confidence that his identity will remain a secret until morning. His aria, which begins with the phrase “Nessun dorma” (“No one shall sleep”), is one of opera’s most dramatic and emotionally powerful moments. Puccini could have set Calaf’s aria in a variety of different ways. For dramatic reasons, he chose to set it as a love song. It is significant for its sense of joy and redemption not seen in the opera up until this point. Does this feeling come from the words or the music? This question forces us to examine the nature of opera. First, we will look at some derivations and generalizations about opera.
This question forces us to examine the nature of opera. First, we will look at some derivations and generalizations about opera. An opera is a drama that combines soliloquy, dialogue, scenery, action and continuous music, the whole greater than the parts. Literally, opera means musical work or composition. 6 Lectures 1 and 2: Introduction and Words and Music The repertory we call opera is a diverse one. In its four hundred-year history opera has run the gamut from aristocratic to popular entertainment. Throughout its history, operatic singing style has changed constantly, depending upon the language being sung, the size of the room being sung in, the ability and taste of the singers, and the expectation of the audience. For most of its history, opera was the single greatest spectacle available to its audiences. It is the oldest continuously active musical genre.
For most of its history, opera was the single greatest spectacle available to its audiences. It is the oldest continuously active musical genre. To what might we attribute the popularity of opera? It is posited on the idea that music has the power to distill, crystallize, and intensify the meaning of words. Children at play, who sing-song their words to themselves and their toys, exemplify the operatic ideal. The primary reason for opera’s lasting popularity is the expressive power of the musical experience. T.S. Eliot said that music “evokes the fringe of indefinite feeling which we can only detect out of the corner of the eye.” Music has the power to evoke the ineffable, moods and states of consciousness that other arts cannot. In opera, the composer is a dramatist. He or she uses music to create the character.
In opera, the composer is a dramatist. He or she uses music to create the character. For example, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart chills us with Electra’s crazed fury as she sings “Of Orestes and Ajax” from Idomeneo (1780). Similarly, Gustav Mahler hits us off guard with the bittersweet feeling of lost love in “As I Walked through the Field this Morning” from his Songs of a Wayfarer (1884). Georges Bizet likewise intrigues us with his revelation of Carmen’s power of sexual manipulation in the “Seguidilla” from Carmen (1875), and Gioacchino Antonio Rossini warms our hearts with Figaro’s upbeat personality in the famous “Largo al factotum” from The Barber of Seville (1816). These arias exemplify the reasons for the enduring popularity of opera.
These arias exemplify the reasons for the enduring popularity of opera. The sheer beauty of the vocal music, along with the excitement of the theater, is an irresistible force. Moreover, there is an incredible intensification For most of its history, opera was the single greatest spectacle available to its audiences. It is the oldest continuously active musical genre. 7 of feeling and meaning when words and music are combined, and this is the essence of opera. The music rounds out the character. It begins where words leave off. The combination of the self-reflective nature of words with the emotionally reflective nature of music packs a powerful appeal. Married to words, music has the ability to evoke symbolic meaning and universally appealing character archetypes. Bizet’s Carmen is the archetypal, street-smart, seductress.
Bizet’s Carmen is the archetypal, street-smart, seductress. Rossini’s Figaro is a comic, clever, fast-talking servant archetype, whose predecessors date back to Roman comedy. This course has several goals. First, we will review an outline of the history of opera from 1600 to 1924 or so. Second, we will observe the development of national schools of opera. Third, we will develop a methodology for listening to and understanding opera. And ultimately, we will celebrate the power of words joined to music! ■ George Bizet’s characters are strongly archetypal. Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-84734.

T he phrase “music as a mirror” means that stylistic change in music and the arts reflects the greater realities of the society in which the composer, artist, and writer live and work. Musical style in the West (European sphere) has constantly adapted to ever-changing societal and cultural realities. There are four tenets to the idea of music as a mirror. The first tenet is that Western music has exhibited ongoing stylistic change since the High Middle Ages. The second is that composers since the High Middle Ages have sought to express something of themselves or their world in their music. The third is that what is considered expressive changes from era to era, and the fourth is that the rate of change has increased exponentially as we move toward the present day. We begin by considering the role of music in the ancient Greek world. The association of music with drama dates back to ancient times.
We begin by considering the role of music in the ancient Greek world. The association of music with drama dates back to ancient times. The composers, poets, philosophers, and historians who invented opera believed they were recreating the environment and techniques of ancient Greek drama. The ancient Greeks believed music to be a microcosm of all creation. Music was present everywhere in ancient Greece. It was played throughout sporting events. Probably most, if not all, ancient Greek drama was sung with accompaniment. Only about forty fragments of ancient (pre-Christian) music have survived. 9 As a musical example of music in ancient Greek drama, we consider the Stasimon Chorus from the drama Orestes, possibly composed by Euripides himself (408 B.C.E.). (A stasimon was the lip between the stage and the audience, where the chorus sat.
(A stasimon was the lip between the stage and the audience, where the chorus sat. This area today is called the “orchestra.”) There are two essential elements in this style of music: A single voice is accompanied by a double reed instrument, and the setting is syllabic in that there is a single pitch for each syllable. This ensures clear articulation. The music is subservient to clarity of speech. The Greek view of music was humanistic. Ancient Greeks believed that music represented the true heart of humankind and the order of the cosmos. They also believed that music could change the face of nature and alter the souls of people and animals. This view of music would last for about 1000 years. In the developments in performance, words, and music that would culminate in opera, another key period was that of the Middle Ages (6001400).
In the developments in performance, words, and music that would culminate in opera, another key period was that of the Middle Ages (6001400). During this period, an important nexus of musical-and culturaldevelopment was the Church. Indeed, the Middle Ages were dominated by the church; thus the era is often called the Theocratic Age or the Age of Theocracy. By 600 C.E. or so, Roman municipal authority had collapsed, leaving the Rome-based Christian church as one of the few bastions against encroaching barbarity. The Rome-based Christian church was founded by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century. The survival of the Church provided a framework for the reemergence of European civilization around the years 900-1000. During the first part of the Middle Ages-the Dark Ages (600-1000)-the great bulk of the music created was for use in worship.
During the first part of the Middle Ages-the Dark Ages (600-1000)-the great bulk of the music created was for use in worship. The predominant style was monophonic vocal music, as, for example, Gregorian chant. It has only one, unaccompanied melody. Instrumental music was discouraged, even outlawed by the church. Its earthy nature was not considered conducive to worship. A musical example is the Mass for Christmas Day, Introit, “Puer natus est nobis.” 10 Lectures 3 and 4: A Brief History of Vocal Expression in Music The High Middle Ages (1000-1400) saw the rebirth of Europe. Populations and food production grew, cities developed, universities were founded, and Romanesque and Gothic architecture developed. Vernacular literature also developed.
Vernacular literature also developed. The power of secular rulers grew, and trade and alliances formed ever-larger political units. The High Middle Ages also saw the creation of several musical innovations. Polyphony was a major development in the 12th through 14th centuries. Composers became named and known, in contrast to the anonymous, itinerant composers of previous eras, and a new class of professional performers began to grow. Musicians began to develop a system of musical notation. In tandem with these developments, a new, secular audience began to grow, and they started adopting a new ritual of respectful listening. In general, increasingly complex modes of musical expression mirrored an increasingly complex world. A new type of organum was developed at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, France. Organum is an early type of polyphony.
A new type of organum was developed at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, France. Organum is an early type of polyphony. The new type of organum is illustrated by Leonin’s “Alleluia pascha nostrum” and “Gaudeat devotio fidelium” (circa 1190). The poet/composer Leonin raised the art of polyphony to a new level. He combined different styles in one piece of music: the old form of plainchant is combined with a new florid organum in which a sustained plainchant in the lower voice is accompanied by fastermoving embellishments in the upper voice. He also added a very new type of dance-like rhythm. We will listen to an example of this in lecture. Secular music grew by leaps and bounds as royal courts and the aristocratic classes grew.
We will listen to an example of this in lecture. Secular music grew by leaps and bounds as royal courts and the aristocratic classes grew. A school of troubadour composers of popular music sprung up. An example of this type of music is Bernart de Ventadorn’s “Can vei la lauzeta mover” (circa 1170). Ancient Greeks believed that music represented the true heart of humankind and the order of the cosmos. They also believed that music could change the face of nature and alter the souls of people and animals. 11 The 14th century saw an end to the absolute authority of the Church as a result of a series of events. First, the Babylonian Captivity occurred. This was a period between 1305 and 1378 when the entire papal court settled in Avignon, France.
This was a period between 1305 and 1378 when the entire papal court settled in Avignon, France. The Babylonian Captivity led to the Great Schism between 1378 and 1417, when there were two, or even three, claimants to the papacy at any one time. People grew tired of this chaos. Over time, the behavior of some high clergy became increasingly corrupt and scandalous. Additionally, the Black Death of 1348-50 caused widespread devastation and soul-searching, and the Hundred Years’ War wreaked enormous havoc. Rulers became increasingly powerful. In general, the world was in transition from one dominated by the Church with its immutable rules to a new world of increasing secularism, humanistic pursuit, and doubt. As a result of all of these changes and events, secular music became high art.
As a result of all of these changes and events, secular music became high art. Much of it exhibits a structural complexity not equaled again until the 1950s. As an example, we will consider Guillaume de Machaut’s “Rose, liz” (circa 1350), a spiky, complex, and beautiful piece by one of the great poet/ composers of the 14th century. The essence of this music is the control of emotion and polyphonic structure. Another important historical period in the development of music, language, and performance was the Renaissance (1400-1600). This period saw the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman culture. Artists, architects, poets, dramatists, philosophers, and composers turned increasingly to pre-Christian models for their inspiration and guidance.
Artists, architects, poets, dramatists, philosophers, and composers turned increasingly to pre-Christian models for their inspiration and guidance. Renaissance composers wanted their music to have the same impact on their listeners as that which the Greeks attributed to their music. By the mid-Renaissance an entirely new view of vocal articulation and system of harmony had come into place to accommodate the new, more humanistic, expressive aims of composers. This was homophony in which one melody predominates with all other musical material heard as accompaniment. Josquin des Prez (circa 1440-1521), the preeminent composer of the midRenaissance, was a master of sacred and secular music. There are several musical examples of this. First, “El Grillo” (circa 1480) exemplifies Josquin’s use of homophony and word painting.
First, “El Grillo” (circa 1480) exemplifies Josquin’s use of homophony and word painting. Unlike the music of Machaut one 12 Lectures 3 and 4: A Brief History of Vocal Expression in Music hundred years before, this music serves the words. Also, “Je me complains” (circa 1480) is a polyphonic piece in which five voices weave in and out of each other. The clarity of the words is not the issue here. Two or three words are being sung simultaneously. The essence of this music lies in its expressive power. It is focused on a depiction of romantic malaise.
The essence of this music lies in its expressive power. It is focused on a depiction of romantic malaise. In the late Renaissance, the most important genre of secular music was the madrigal, a work for four to six singers, based on high art poetry, that freely mixes homophony and polyphony and focuses on word painting. Madrigals were sung at aristocratic gatherings at European courts, especially in Italy. Thomas Weelkes’ “As Vesta was from Latmos Hill descending” (1601) is a lighthearted madrigal of the late Renaissance in which word painting is taken to extremes. Note that “maiden Queen” and Oriana refer to the “Virgin Queen” Elizabeth I. Diana was the Roman goddess of virginity and Vesta was a virgin goddess.
■ 13 The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo Lectures 5-8 The intermedio was important-in fact, vital-as a forerunner of opera for two essential reasons: first, because it kept alive in the minds of Italian poets and musicians the idea of close collaboration between drama and music; and second, because in these works, in these intermezzi, the external form of opera is already clear: a drama with interludes of music, dancing, splendid scenery, and spectacular stage effects. W e begin this lecture by reviewing the material we have discussed up to this point. First, the Greek ideal of music posited that music is a force that can move nature and change the hearts and souls of people. Second, the Renaissance saw a growing awareness of the Greek ideal of music.
Second, the Renaissance saw a growing awareness of the Greek ideal of music. And third, the madrigal is a late-Renaissance experimental genre in which “expression” is based on word painting. Carlo Gesualdo’s madrigal “Io parto e non piu dissi” (circa 1595) is expressive of a lovers’ quarrel. It is full of unbelievable harmonic complexity. Major amounts of unresolved dissonance (known as chromaticism) correspond to the dissonance felt by the lovers. We will listen to a musical example. We now move on to a consideration of the intermezzo/intermedio. This performance component developed alongside the madrigal. It was presented between the acts of spoken plays.
This performance component developed alongside the madrigal. It was presented between the acts of spoken plays. Many intermezzi/intermedi became more interesting than the plays in which they were inserted, and they were an important forerunner of opera. Another important development in the progression towards opera was the pastorale. This style of dramatic poetry dominated Italian theater in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Pastorales feature sylvan settings and mild love adventures, usually ending happily. 14 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo From an intellectual and theoretical standpoint, another important event in the story of opera was the collaboration of the Florentine Camerata.
The Florentine Camerata was a ridotto, or a private academy or intellectual club, that met in the home of Giovanni Bardi di Vernio from 1573 to 1592. Of special interest to this group was the nature of musical and dramatic expression. Among the members of the Florentine Camerata was Vincenzo Galilei, who wrote a scathing attack on the artificiality of expression in madrigals. Based largely on the ideas of scholar Girolamo Mei, the group decreed that true musical expression could only be achieved by a single singer employing an actor’s dramatic and oratorical skills. The Florentine Camerata developed a new theory of music.
The Florentine Camerata developed a new theory of music. Their theory was based on the Greek expressive ideal and involved several rules for music and musical performance: * The text must be sung by one singer, accompanied as simply as possible so that the words are clearly understood. * The words must be sung the way they are spoken (natural declamation). No dance rhythms can be imposed upon the words. * The music must depict the feelings and emotions of the character singing. The first works that we today call operas were created by members of the Florentine Camerata. Daphne was created by the poet Ottavio Rinuccini and the composer Jacopo Peri in 1598. The music is lost today.
Daphne was created by the poet Ottavio Rinuccini and the composer Jacopo Peri in 1598. The music is lost today. Euridice was created by Rinuccini and Peri in 1600, and in the same year a second version was produced by Rinuccini and Giulio Caccini. Euridice was first performed on October 6, 1600 in Florence, Italy. A fully staged production with alternating choruses, rhyming pop-type songs, and early recitative (stile rappresentativo), Peri’s Euridice is a play set to music, not a play conceived musically. The character of Orfeo (Orpheus), with his ability to change souls and the very face of nature with his music, personifies both opera and the Greek view of music.
15 The first great composer of opera was Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643). He did not invent opera but was inspired to create a new operatic ideal. Born in Cremona, Italy, he rose to the pinnacle of the musical profession in the 17th century as choirmaster at St. Mark’s cathedral in Venice. Of his nineteen stage works only six have survived intact, including his first opera Orfeo, which represents the first completely successful attempt to apply the full resources of musical and dramatic art to the new genre of opera. Orfeo (1607) is an extraordinary synthesis of the musical genres and compositional techniques available in the time when it was produced. The toccata (overture) demonstrates the large instrumental ensemble (around forty players) Monteverdi calls for in Orfeo.
The toccata (overture) demonstrates the large instrumental ensemble (around forty players) Monteverdi calls for in Orfeo. The character of Orpheus lies at the heart of the drama as the personification of dramatic musical art. He symbolizes the power of music. Yet while he can control external forces with his music, he cannot control his own emotions. In Act 1 of Orfeo, there is happiness and joy in arcadia. Eurydice has finally agreed to marry Orpheus. They celebrate with friends. Monteverdi’s style of recitative (half sung, half spoken music) is known as arioso, closer to actual song than Peri’s.
As a musical example, consider “In questo lieto.” Another musical example is ballet/chorus, “Lasciate i monti.” This chorus is full of sexual symbolism. The excitement builds up to the entrance of the star couple. Orpheus, appropriately, sings a richer arioso, “Rosa del ciel,” than the other characters. Act 1, like most first operatic first acts, is dramatically static. It represents an incredible synthesis of various musical forms: the toccata (opening music, or overture), ritornello (orchestral refrain), recitative (in Monteverdi’s inimitable style), symbolic chorus (“Vieni, Imeneo”), ballet, popular song (“Lasciate i monti”), religious-type music (“Ma se il nostro”), and final, celebratory music.
The first great composer of opera was Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643). He did not invent opera but was inspired to create a new operatic ideal. 16 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo In the second act of Orfeo, grief comes to paradise. Orpheus sings his last bit of joy in “Vi ricorda,” but then the celebrations are cut short with the news of Eurydice’s death. The messenger’s story is a brilliant, masterful composition. She begins slowly, almost monotonically, and builds up to a powerful climax as she tells her tragic tale. Then, exhausted, she concludes on a bleak note. This is exemplified by “Ahi, caso acerbo.” Orpheus’s response, “Tu se’ morta,” is a profoundly moving and brilliantly written moment.
It is followed by a madrigal-style chorus replete with word painting: “Ahi, caso acerbo.” Monteverdi employs a stunning stroke. He brings back the ritornello heard at the beginning of the opera. Now it takes on a whole new dimension as it reflects both the tragic events of the act as well as Orpheus’s determination to rescue Eurydice from death, armed with a single weapon-the power of music itself. Act 3 involves the journey to Hades in search of Eurydice. The opening sinfonia is dominated by brass instruments, which were associated with the underworld. Charon, the boatman who takes souls to the underworld, is a deep bass, accompanied by a regal (reed organ).
Charon, the boatman who takes souls to the underworld, is a deep bass, accompanied by a regal (reed organ). He sings “O tu, ch’innanzi morte.” Orpheus’s plea, “Possente spirito” is-as it should be-the crown jewel of the opera. While he does not succeed in softening Charon’s heart and gaining entry to Hades, his music does have a beneficial effect on the formidable boatman. It puts him to sleep! A firm comment on the nature of opera audiences everywhere! For a musical example, we will listen to Orpheus’s “Ei dorme.” In Act 4, Pluto presents a challenge and Orpheus experiences a downfall.
Pluto, king of the underworld, agrees to allow Eurydice to follow Orpheus back up to the world of mortals as long as he does not look back at her. Orpheus disobeys and Eurydice is forced back to Hades. Her “Ahi, vista troppo” is memorable for its extraordinarily dissonant harmonies. Act 5 is marked by Orpheus’s despair and Apollo’s divine intervention. 17 In conclusion, we note that in Orfeo Monteverdi succeeds on every level. His opera synthesizes all the different genres. It is a brilliant example of the power of recitative to embody and magnify the power of words. It also represents the marriage of drama and music. The whole is greater than the parts.
It also represents the marriage of drama and music. The whole is greater than the parts. Additionally, in Orfeo the Greek ideal of the power of music to “calm every troubled heart and... kindle the most icy souls”, as described in the prologue, has been redefined and reinvented. ■ 18 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo 19 20 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo 21 22 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo 23 24 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo 25 26 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s

Orfeo 49 50 Lectures 5-8: The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo The Growth of Opera, the Development of Italian Opera Seria, and Mozart’s Idomeneo Lectures 9-12 The earliest operas were a synthesis.... We tend to treat the word “synthetic” today as something bad; if something is synthetic, it’s not made out of real stuff. But in terms of music, the word “synthesis” is an important and a good word, because it indicates various different styles and types of music combined, where the whole hopefully is greater than the parts. W e will begin by reviewing the birth of opera and its early history, and then we will move on to discussion of the invention of the aria.
W e will begin by reviewing the birth of opera and its early history, and then we will move on to discussion of the invention of the aria. The earliest operas were a synthesis of old and new musical and dramatic genres and compositional techniques. Four elements were inherited from the Renaissance: stage scenery and machinery, dance/ballet episodes, popular songs/ballads, and madrigal-style choruses. These early operas also included the recitative element, which was new. Monteverdi’s Orfeo was the first successful work to combine all these elements into a singularity greater than the parts. Recitative was the essence of Monteverdi’s operatic art. It was used for everything: action, narrative, dialogue and description of feelings. Because of the non-reflective and ever forward-moving nature of recitative, time cannot stop for consideration and reflection.
Because of the non-reflective and ever forward-moving nature of recitative, time cannot stop for consideration and reflection. For example, Orfeo’s reaction to Euridice’s death is recitative, and in it, he does not stop to reflect. There was little emotional depth in this genre at this point in its development. The concept of aria, in which music is divorced from words and creates a whole expressive world of its own, had not yet been realized. Moreover, recitative focuses on words, not music, which further limits emotional depth. A musical example in Orfeo is Orpheus’ response. In considering aria, we begin with the musical example of “Chiamo il mio ben cosi” from Christoph Willibald von Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice (1762). In an aria, the words and music are on an equal footing.
In an aria, the words and music are on an equal footing. Additionally, real 51 52 Lectures 9-12: The Growth of Opera, the Development of Italian Opera Seria, and Mozart’s Idomeneo time stops. Orpheus can experience and express in music a depth of feeling far beyond that of words alone. The use of music as an expressive vehicle, which began with the earliest arias, is revolutionary. Gluck’s operas mark the starting point for the modern opera repertory. The period between Monteverdi (1567-1643) and Gluck (1714-1787) is sometimes called both the golden age of opera and the dark age of opera (a period which runs from 1640 through 1750). This period was very secular in terms of philosophy and science. It saw logical thought as transcendent.
This period was very secular in terms of philosophy and science. It saw logical thought as transcendent. This development influenced music, resulting in a hugely expanded musical language. The harmonic system came into its own. Instrumental music became as popular as vocal music, and with the development of instrumental music there came a self-sufficient, pure, abstract musical language. This was Gluck’s inheritance: a musical language that could create what could not be expressed in words alone. The first phase of this period ran from 1640 through 1700. During this phase, the first public opera houses were opened. Also, opera quickly became a ubiquitous public entertainment in Italy. Huge numbers of operas were created and produced. The popularity of opera during this era can be compared with the popularity of television for modern audiences.
Huge numbers of operas were created and produced. The popularity of opera during this era can be compared with the popularity of television for modern audiences. Singing style and stage design developed rapidly. Opera captured the exuberant, expressive spirit of the Baroque. The quality of libretti declined in order to meet the growing public demand for spectacle, situation, and virtuosic singing (a situation again comparable with much contemporary television programming). Opera pulled further away from the Greek ideal. Choruses were used less and less as the demand for virtuoso soloists grew. Despite their number and fame, however, Baroque operas are seldom produced, due to their dramatic stupidity and strange, often bizarre content; thus the dark age of opera.
The period between Monteverdi (1567-1643) and Gluck (1714-1787) is sometimes called both the golden age of opera and the dark age of opera (a period which runs from 1640 through 1750). 53 By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, literary devotees of opera were determined to reform the medium and return to it a degree of literary and dramatic substance. These reforms characterized the second phase of the golden/dark age of opera, which ran from 1700 through 1760. Chief among the reformers of this phase was Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782). He was the great librettist of the first half of the 18th century. He standardized his libretti into a formulaic dramatic procedure (comparable with today’s television sitcoms).
He standardized his libretti into a formulaic dramatic procedure (comparable with today’s television sitcoms). In opera developed during the second phase of the golden/dark age of opera, dry recitative (accompanied only by a harpsichord and, sometimes, a cello) alternated with arias. The principal characters had to sing one or two arias in each act. Subsidiary singers were only permitted one or two arias in the course of the entire opera. Every opera had three acts. No two successive arias could use the same singer, mood, or orchestration; and choruses, duets, and other ensembles were very rare, except for the final number, when all principal singers had to line up for an ensemble in block harmony. Plots were based on mythological characters and ancient history. This is the formula for Italian opera seria.
Plots were based on mythological characters and ancient history. This is the formula for Italian opera seria. Metastasio formularized arias into a structure called the da capo aria: A-B-A form. As a musical example we consider “Mi rivedi” from Alessandro Scarlatti’s La Griselda (1721). Arias became classified into standard types. There are many different types, including the five we will describe here. First, the aria cantabile showcases all of the singer’s lyrical ability. The aria di portamento is a dignified aria designed to show off the singer’s breath and tone control. The aria di mezzo caratere is a compromise between the aria cantabile and the aria di bravura.
The aria di mezzo caratere is a compromise between the aria cantabile and the aria di bravura. The aria parlante (patter aria) demonstrates the singer’s agility, and the aria di bravura (or aria d’agilità) is highly florid and designed to show off the singer’s agility and extraordinary vocal compass. As a result of the predictability of the Metastasian operatic formula, singers and vocal virtuosity increasingly became the focal points of reform opera. Singers embellished the written notes and improvised solo passages at the ends of arias. These embellished and extended cadences became known 54 Lectures 9-12: The Growth of Opera, the Development of Italian Opera Seria, and Mozart’s Idomeneo as cadenzas. The greatest vocal abuses were promulgated by the castrati.
The greatest vocal abuses were promulgated by the castrati. For a musical example, we will review “Siam navi all’onde” from Antonio Vivaldi’s L’Olimpiade of 1734. We now turn to a discussion of voice types. Basic voice classifications include soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. The soprano is the highest female voice, and the coloratura soprano is the highest of the soprano voices. The term coloratura refers to virtuosic singing, not vocal range. Coloratura sopranos are distinguished by their range, clarity, and agility as exemplified in the Queen of the Night’s aria, “Der Hölle Rache” from Mozart’s The Magic Flute of 1791 (musical example). The lyric soprano is a fairly light, warm, and flexible voice.
The lyric soprano is a fairly light, warm, and flexible voice. The dramatic soprano on the other hand is a heavier, darker, and larger voice than lyric. The spinto soprano is a voice lying between a lyric and a dramatic soprano, and the mezzo-soprano is heavier, darker, and lower than a true soprano, approaching the alto voice. The contralto (alto) is a female voice of exceptionally low focus. The tenor is the highest male voice. The lyric tenor is a light, clear, and flexible voice, while the dramatic tenor is a more forceful, powerful voice, capable of greater volume and endurance. As a musical example, please consider Otello’s entrance from Act 1 of Verdi’s Otello (1886).
As a musical example, please consider Otello’s entrance from Act 1 of Verdi’s Otello (1886). The baritone is slightly lower in range, heavier, and fuller in sound than the tenor, and the bass is the lowest male voice. It is a rich, dark, heavy, and powerful voice that is not particularly agile. A good musical example is Charon’s song from Monteverdi’s Orfeo, Act 3 (1607). We now return to Christoph Willibald von Gluck (1714-1787) and a consideration of his reforms. Gluck was Bohemian by birth. He split his mature career between Vienna and Paris and was a brilliant composer of Italian-style operas. Gluck’s operas were along the lines of traditional opera seria. They distinguished themselves, however, in their dramatic viability.
Gluck’s operas were along the lines of traditional opera seria. They distinguished themselves, however, in their dramatic viability. Gluck believed strongly in telling a good story. To do so, he used his orchestra much more flexibly. He also simplified and streamlined his arias to reduce 55 singers’ abuses and to restore the dramatic integrity of his operas. His operas became models for the next generation of opera composers. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s (1756-1791) Idomeneo, Re di Creta (Idomeneo, King of Crete) is the greatest opera seria. The libretto is by G. B. Varesco. Mozart is one of the few great opera composers not to have been an opera specialist.
Mozart is one of the few great opera composers not to have been an opera specialist. He wrote operas in all the styles popular in his time: opera seria, Gluck’s reform-style opera, opera buffa, and Singspiel. His first opera was La finta semplice (The Pretended Simpleton) of 1768. Idomeneo is the transcendent opera seria. In its story, Ilia (lyric soprano), the daughter of Priam, King of Troy, is in love with Idamante, who is also in love with her. He (soprano or tenor; the part was originally written for a castrato) is the prince and heir to the Cretan throne. Half-mad Greek princess Elektra is also in love with Idamante.
Half-mad Greek princess Elektra is also in love with Idamante. Idomeneo is the King of Crete and father of Idamante. The action takes place on Crete, ten years after the end of the Trojan War. Idomeneo, in order to survive a shipwreck, promises to sacrifice to Neptune the first person he sees on landing in Crete. This turns out to be Idamante, his son and heir. Idomeneo desperately tries to find a way to avoid keeping his oath to Neptune. In Act 2, the momentum builds to a tremendous degree as Mozart employs every device he can to avoid the formulaic and predictable dramatic action typical of opera seria. Each vocal number merges with the next. The use of a trio was rare in Mozart’s day.
Each vocal number merges with the next. The use of a trio was rare in Mozart’s day. He uses one in this act to break the predictable pattern. He also uses recitative for Idomeneo’s monologue “Eccoti in me, barbaro Nume!” He knew that an aria at this point would have slowed the pace and killed the dramatic momentum. Musical examples abound and Mozart, whose Idomeneo is the greatest opera seria, transcending the formulas and predictability of the genre. The Teaching Company Collection. 56 Lectures 9-12: The Growth of Opera, the Development of Italian Opera Seria, and Mozart’s Idomeneo include Elektra’s recitative, “Parto, e l’unico” and no.
14 (march); Elektra’s recitative “Sidonie sponde”; the No. 15 (chorus), “Placido è il mar”/Elektra’s aria, “Soavi zeffiri” and Idomeneo’s recitative, “Troppo t’arresti”; the No. 16 (trio) from “Deh cessi il scompiglio”; the No. 17 (chorus), “Qual nuovo terrore!”; Idomeneo’s recitative, “Eccoti in me, barbaro nume!”; and the No. 18 (chorus), “Corriamo, fuggiamo.” In conclusion, we note that the seamlessness of this music takes Idomeneo out of the category of traditional opera seria.
The non-seria elements are as follows: The recitatives are accompanied, recitatives and arias do not automatically alternate, the use of a trio is unusual, flexible use is made of the chorus, and the orchestra transitions smoothly from one section to the next. ■ The Rise of Opera Buffa and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro Lectures 13-16 Comic opera-slapstick, satirical, often bawdy, and almost always irreverent-has had a very different history than that of serious opera or what we call opera seria.... Comic opera has its roots in popular entertainment, and this is a huge and very enduring difference C omic opera developed quite separately from opera seria, which was an entertainment of the aristocracy. Comic opera had its roots in popular entertainment.
Comic opera had its roots in popular entertainment. It grew out of comic musical entertainment that traveling musicians had staged since the Middle Ages. In 16th-century Italy, these developed into a tradition of traveling companies called commedia dell’arte. During the second half of the 17th century, comic interludes, drawn from the situations and characters of commedia dell’arte, were inserted between the acts of serious operas. By the end of the 18th century, the once lowbrow comic intermezzi had developed into the dominant operatic genre of opera buffa. Comic opera/opera buffa grew out of the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on popular, nonelitist art and its spirit of dramatic and musical naturalism. The melodic content of the new opera buffa reflected the more natural, populist, melodic spirit of Classical-era Enlightenment music.
The melodic content of the new opera buffa reflected the more natural, populist, melodic spirit of Classical-era Enlightenment music. To understand opera buffa more fully, we will compare two musical examples: “Siam navi all’onde algenti” from Vivaldi’s L’Olimpiade (1734) and “Non più andrai” from Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro (1786). Vivaldi’s music is highly artificial and extreme in its use of embellishments and in its sentiments. Mozart’s music is far more natural-sounding. This new, Enlightenment-inspired music, with its focus on accessible melodies, is known as the Classical style. It is classical in the ancient Greek sense because of its clarity of line, balanced structures, emotional restraint, and elegance.
It is classical in the ancient Greek sense because of its clarity of line, balanced structures, emotional restraint, and elegance. 57 58 Lectures 13-16: The Rise of Opera Buffa and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro Opera buffa also was affected by the political conditions of its time. By the mid-18th century, Baroque opera seria came to represent the old, elite, aristocratic order. Its main elements were formulaic use of recitative and ariathey followed one another predictably; grandiose and expensive productions; libretti based on ancient history and mythology; stiff, overblown characters; and da capo arias, with very few ensembles and almost no choruses. The predictability of the arias led to abuses by the singers.
The predictability of the arias led to abuses by the singers. Enlightenment philosophers and artists saw opera buffa-with its accessible melodies, small casts, and everyday dramatic situations-as the ideal opera for the new spirit of the Enlightenment. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) took the lead in this rejection of Baroque opera seria. He and his followers embraced Giovanni Pergolesi’s La serva padrona as the new ideal for opera. La serva padrona (1733) is early opera buffa. It began as an intermezzo, although it was later performed as an opera. Typical of the early version of its genre, it features lively, catchy music in which no particular formulas are followed.
Typical of the early version of its genre, it features lively, catchy music in which no particular formulas are followed. It also features a cast of only three characters: Serpina (soprano), Uberto (bass) and Vespone (mute). The plot involves a simple ruse by which a servant (Serpina) tricks an old bachelor (Uberto) into marriage. A musical example is the recitative and aria, “Son imbrogliato io già.” Even as it evolved, opera buffa continued to use commedia dell’arte character archetypes. The most significant character division in opera buffa is between savvy, street-smart servants and members of the lower class, on the one hand, and blundering, pompous aristocrats, merchants, doctors, and lawyers, on the other.
Almost by their nature, then, opera buffa plots were politicized in an era when class distinctions underwent profound reexamination. Mozart wrote many operas buffa. In his youth he wrote La finta semplice (1768) and La finta giardiniera (1775). He created his best known and most esteemed works with librettist Lorenzo da Ponte, a brilliant and controversial figure. Da Ponte remains, along with Metastasio, Boito and Hofmannsthal, Almost by their nature... opera buffa plots were politicized in an era when class distinctions underwent profound reexamination. 59 one of the great librettists in opera history. The works that he and Mozart developed together include The Marriage of Figaro (1786), Don Giovanni (1787), and Così fan tutte (1789).
We will look at The Marriage of Figaro in greater detail. Its basic story line is adapted from two plays by the French dramatist Pierre de Beaumarchais (1732-1799): The Barber of Seville (1772) and The Marriage of Figaro (1784). In The Barber of Seville we meet a young Count Almaviva, who, with the help of his former valet Figaro, wins and weds the young and cunning Rosina. This play concludes with the count’s renunciation of his feudal right to deflower any maiden in his service on her wedding night. The Marriage of Figaro takes place three years later. The count has become a shameless philanderer. Rosina (the countess) is wise beyond her years. Figaro is to marry Susanna, whom the count intends to bed before her marriage.
Rosina (the countess) is wise beyond her years. Figaro is to marry Susanna, whom the count intends to bed before her marriage. The action of the play (and opera) revolves around the count’s determination to seduce Susanna, and Figaro and Susanna’s determination to marry before he can force the issue. Beaumarchais’ play was a clear attack on the French aristocracy. The play was initially banned in France and permanently banned in Austria. Da Ponte’s libretto removed much of what was politically offensive (although Mozart’s music puts much of it back in!). Our game plan in discussing this play will involve two components. First, we will meet the main characters and observe Mozart’s incredible musical portraiture. Second, we will observe the quintessence of Mozart’s dramatic craft by examining the Act 2 finale.
Second, we will observe the quintessence of Mozart’s dramatic craft by examining the Act 2 finale. We will begin our discussion of Act 1 of The Marriage of Figaro by considering some musical examples. First, the overture; this is a perfect combination of great musical substance and great musical beauty. Also, the opera opens with a duet for Figaro and Susanna, “Cinque, dieci, venti,” that is memorable for the way Mozart conveys perfect harmony between Susanna and Figaro by writing their music in thirds and sixths. Susanna tells her fiancé Figaro that Count Almaviva is planning to seduce her: no.
Susanna tells her fiancé Figaro that Count Almaviva is planning to seduce her: no. 2 (duet), “Se a caso madama.” In his recitative, “Bravo, signor padrone!” and his cavatina, “Se vuol ballare,” Figaro shows his determination to outwit the count. 60 Lectures 13-16: The Rise of Opera Buffa and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro Dr. Bartolo and Marcellina are introduced. Dr. Bartolo is the former guardian of Rosina. He had planned to marry Rosina himself, but was thwarted by Figaro and Count Almaviva. (The role of Dr. Bartolo is sung by a bass, in the Italian tradition of assigning the bass voice to older men and villains.) Marcellina is Bartolo’s former maid.
Marcellina is Bartolo’s former maid. She once lent Figaro money and this loan has now come due. Figaro promised to marry Marcellina if he could not repay the loan. Figaro and Susanna are planning to repay the loan with the dowry to be given them by the count. For their own personal reasons, Dr. Bartolo and Marcellina want Figaro to fail to repay the loan. The relevant musical example here is no. 4 (aria) “La vendetta.” We will now examine the ways in which the characters in The Marriage of Figaro are, and are not, archetypes of commedia dell’arte. First, the inspiration for Dr. Bartolo comes from Pantalone, a character who prides himself on being an expert on many subjects, but one who actually knows very little and is always being caught out.
The character of Figaro on the other hand is based on harlequin, an athletic, graceful, cunning valet and ladies’ man, who claims noble birth. Rosina’s character comes from Colombina, a pretty, young girl with a sharp wit and an acid tongue. Marcellina is the only character not based on commedia dell’arte. She is an old, rapacious spinster, inspired by a character in classic Roman comedies. Cherubino, an oversexed adolescent, is introduced. Mozart’s depicts his character in an aria brilliantly evocative of a breathless, love-sick adolescent: no.
Mozart’s depicts his character in an aria brilliantly evocative of a breathless, love-sick adolescent: no. 6 (aria) “Non so più cosa son.” The predatory and unscrupulous Count Almaviva is also introduced with “Ah, no Susanna.” The count decides that Cherubino is getting in his way and tries to pack him off to the army. Figaro sings a satirical farewell to Cherubino. He paints a dire picture of life in the army in the hope of dissuading Cherubino from leaving. He needs the boy as an ally in his plan to thwart the count’s designs on Susanna. Figaro’s aria, “Non più andrai,” (in rondo form) is what first made this opera a success. In Act 2 of The Marriage of Figaro, the countess (Rosina) is introduced.
In Act 2 of The Marriage of Figaro, the countess (Rosina) is introduced. Still very young, and wise beyond her years, she prays for the return of her philandering husband’s affections in one of Mozart’s most beautiful 61 and moving arias, “Porgi amor.” As a result of various intrigues, the count becomes convinced that the countess is having an affair. He is incensed and determined to learn the truth. An opera buffa finale is itself conceived as a miniature comedy. Mozart’s Act 2 finale is in eight distinct parts, 20 minutes (or so) of continuous music. In Part 1, the count is convinced that Cherubino and the countess have been having an affair and that Cherubino is hiding in the countess’s closet. At this point there are two characters onstage: the count and countess.
At this point there are two characters onstage: the count and countess. In Part 2, the count discovers, to his surprise, not Cherubino but Susanna in the closet. In Part 3, the mood completely changes as the count calms down and asks for his wife’s forgiveness, and in Parts 4 and 5, Figaro enters and there are now four characters onstage. The mood grows quieter as the count tries to figure out what is going on. He questions Figaro about an anonymous note he received, but Figaro refuses to answer. In Part 6, Antonio, the gardener, enters the scene. We now have a quintet. Antonio unwittingly stirs up more trouble when he complains that someone jumped out of a window and ruined his flowerbed.
Antonio unwittingly stirs up more trouble when he complains that someone jumped out of a window and ruined his flowerbed. This is followed by Parts 7 and 8, in which the comic confusion increases and the dramatic and musical tension comes to a climax with the entrance of Don Basilio, Dr. Bartolo, and Marcellina, who has come to claim Figaro as her husband! We now have seven characters onstage singing their own lines simultaneously in a variety of ensembles and solos. The Act 2 finale is a brilliant continuous sequence of ensembles of increasingly long, separate musical lines, all coming together. Only a great writer of symphonies or string quartets could have written this finale, which is equally remarkable for its dramatic power.
Only a great writer of symphonies or string quartets could have written this finale, which is equally remarkable for its dramatic power. Mozart’s music enhances dramatic momentum and creates a whole new drama of underlying subtleties and truths not revealed in the libretto. Mozart’s operas are not “easy-listening.” They require our total involvement. Nor were they considered easy to listen to in Mozart’s own time. His characters live and breathe; his music imbues them with an extraordinary range of moods, emotions, subtlety, unconscious motivation, and humanity. ■ 62 Lectures 13-16: The Rise of Opera Buffa and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro ` 63 64 Lectures 13-16: The Rise of Opera Buffa and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro 65 66 Lectures 13-16: The Rise

Barber of Seville Lectures 17 and 18 I’m about to tell you how quickly these Italian opera composers wrote operas, and how many operas they were expected to turn out with great rapidity. It might seem stunning to us... and to a degree it is stunning. We’ve got to remember there were tried and true techniques. There were... compositional processes that [allow]... you [to]... turn out a lot really quickly, as long as you don’t seek to be original. B y the early 19th century, opera in Italy was widely popular, and its popularity led it to become a conventional, highly profitable commercial enterprise. Italian composers were not so susceptible to the romanticism sweeping the rest of Europe. Instead, they focused more attention on opera, often to the exclusion of other musical forms.
Instead, they focused more attention on opera, often to the exclusion of other musical forms. They did not experiment to the extent that their French and German neighbors did. All of this led to a conservative type of opera. The type of opera in favor was the opera buffa, or comic opera. The melodic style of these predominantly comic, early-19th-century Italian operas was direct, tuneful, and, in every sense of the word, popular. It is known as the bel canto style. This style also favored directness and simplicity of harmonic language and character development and a predictable comic and dramatic setup. The principal composers of bel canto operas were Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848), Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835), and Gioacchino Antonio Rossini (1792-1868).
In terms of the business conditions under which bel canto operas were created, it is important to know that composers and librettists traveled from city to city creating operas in as little as two weeks before moving on. In order to meet their deadlines, composers would often reuse in newly commissioned operas music written for earlier ones. Operas could be written quickly and in profusion thanks to widely accepted formulas for composing stock material. 111 112 Lectures 17 and 18: The Bel Canto Style and Rossini’s The Barber of Seville One typical bel canto opera is Rossini’s The Barber of Seville, a favorite since its composition in 1816. Rossini’s contract for The Barber was typical for the time. The libretto was chosen by the local impresario, and Rossini had to agree to any and all modifications requested by the singers.
The libretto was chosen by the local impresario, and Rossini had to agree to any and all modifications requested by the singers. He also had to room with the baritone so that the impresario could keep an eye on him. Additionally, he was required to be present for rehearsals and the first three performances. Dates were specified for completion of the first act and for opening night, and compensation was the equivalent of two hundred dollars plus a coat with gold buttons. The libretto was written by Cesare Sterbini and based on a play by PierreAugustin Beaumarchais. Though written by a French dramatist, The Barber of Seville is based on character archetypes drawn from the Italian commedia dell’arte. The Barber of Seville was first turned into an opera by composer Giovanni Paisello and librettist Giuseppe Petrosellini in 1782.
The Barber of Seville was first turned into an opera by composer Giovanni Paisello and librettist Giuseppe Petrosellini in 1782. Paisello’s Barber was considered a classic, and there was considerable audience resistance to another opera based on the same story. Despite opening night problems with Paisello’s clique, Rossini’s Barber was almost immediately recognized as the superior work. In considering this opera, we will begin by meeting the main characters and considering musical examples that convey their identities and goals to the audience. Then we will review the music lesson scene as an example of Rossini’s superb comedic craft. Lastly, we will address elements that make this a bel canto opera. The cast of characters of The Barber of Seville is as follows: * Rosina, a witty, vivacious sixteen-year-old, is the ward of Dr. Bartolo. * Dr.
Bartolo. * Dr. Bartolo, Rosina’s guardian, is a ponderous, pompous, nasty old fogey who intends to marry Rosina for her inheritance. 113 * Count Almaviva, a young nobleman desperately in love with Rosina, is posing as a love-struck soldier named Lindoro. * Figaro, Almaviva’s former valet, is now a jack-of-all-trades (factotum) living in Seville, where the opera takes place. * Count Almaviva. In terms of musical examples, we begin with the aria “Ecco, redente in cielo,” which acquaints us more thoroughly with the count. From his aria, we discover that he is a lovesick sap. The simple, direct, and sentimental nature of the music mirrors the count himself.
From his aria, we discover that he is a lovesick sap. The simple, direct, and sentimental nature of the music mirrors the count himself. His serenade elicits no response, and he is crestfallen. On the other hand, we learn more about Figaro through his “patter-style” aria “Largo al factotum.” We discover that he is a man of irrepressible spirit and energy, he is clever and street-smart, and he is much more interesting and complex than the count. We also see that Figaro has genuine self-knowledge; he knows who and what he is, and he likes himself. The count hears this aria and recognizes his old employee. He hires Figaro on the spot to assist him in winning Rosina. Rosina drops a note to Figaro and Count Almaviva.
He hires Figaro on the spot to assist him in winning Rosina. Rosina drops a note to Figaro and Count Almaviva. In it she says she wants to know who Almaviva is. The note makes it clear that she is a strong young woman with a mind of her own. Indeed, she will prove to be the brains of the plot. This is already hinted at in the instrumental introduction to her entrance aria, “Una voce poco fa.” Rosina’s aria tells us that she is filled with youthful energy and optimism, she can be flirtatious and romantic, and that she cannot and will not be controlled by anyone-indeed, she is in control and the mistress of her own fate.
Her aria is an entrance aria, serving to introduce her character, like the other two arias in this opera that we have considered thus far: Figaro’s “Largo al factotum” and Almaviva’s “Ecco, redente in cielo.” Rosina begins with recitative and then goes into a cavatina. A cavatina is an aria that shows off a singer’s ability to hold line. This particular cavatina is 114 Lectures 17 and 18: The Bel Canto Style and Rossini’s The Barber of Seville an example of Rossini at his best. It is virtuosic and pure bel canto, full of coloratura melismas. A melisma is an embellishment of the vocal line, when an ornamental group of different pitches are assigned to a single syllable.
A melisma is an embellishment of the vocal line, when an ornamental group of different pitches are assigned to a single syllable. The bel canto style is characterized by highly embellished arias requiring an unusual vocal flexibility and the ability to reach very high notes. In fact, in bel canto opera, singers were expected to embellish their arias. Female singers who could do this well became superstar divas. Because they attracted large audiences, they won immense control: they could demand autonomy, huge fees, and a freedom not generally enjoyed by women at that time. We now turn to Dr. Bartolo’s aria “A un dottor della mia sorte.” From this aria we learn that Bartolo is a pompous, condescending blowhard who hasn’t a chance against the combined forces of Almaviva, Figaro, and Rosina.
In another aria, “La calunnia è un venticello,” we learn about the character of Don Basilio, who makes Bartolo look like a saint. Basilio’s brand of intrigue is the lowest of the low and is bound to fail. His aria contains an example of a “Rossini crescendo.” We will now discuss the music lesson from Act 2 in The Barber of Seville. In this part of the opera, the count, disguised as a music teacher, gains access to Bartolo’s house. The music lesson commences with Rosina singing an incredibly ornate aria in the bel canto style. Bartolo, true to form, falls asleep in an armchair. Upon awaking, he regrets the passing of his musical era and proceeds to sing a light, opera seria-type aria in the style of the castrato Caffariello.
In bel canto opera, singers were expected to embellish their arias.... Because [superstar divas] attracted large audiences... they could demand autonomy, huge fees, and a freedom not generally enjoyed by women at that time. 115 In conclusion, we note that the bel canto style is based on a deep-rooted Italian conviction that opera is essentially the highest manifestation of song and that its purpose is to delight and entertain its listeners with unsentimental, melodious, and spontaneous music. We know bel canto when we see and hear it because in this type of opera the melodic lines of arias are embellished, the melodies are tuneful and popular, there is no in-depth characterization (all of the characters are one-dimensional caricatures), dialogue is witty and sparkling, the opera overall is always comic, and the dramatic setup is predictable.
Very few composers have equaled Rossini for sheer tunefulness. He was advised by Beethoven to stick with opera buffa. Beethoven’s advice notwithstanding, Rossini increasingly composed grand and serious operas. By the 1840s opera buffa fell out of favor in Italy, to be replaced by serious, grand opera; however, Rossini’s buffa operas never lost their popularity. ■ 116 Lectures 19-22: Verdi and Otello Verdi and Otello Lectures 19-22 At no point did Verdi purposely break with his past or experiment radically with new operatic theories. His evolution was toward refinement of dramatic content, toward refinement of technique, and in the end, of course, he brought Italian opera to a pinnacle that has never been surpassed.
Verdi’s aim, then, was always toward refinement and intensification of dramatic line, singing technique, literary and emotional truth. T he career of Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) practically constitutes the history of Italian opera from 1850 to 1900. Verdi composed 26 operas. He was not an innovator or reformer. Rather, his operatic craft slowly evolved across the span of his long compositional career. Verdi was born near Parma, Italy, to a middle-class family. His musical education was sponsored by a rich local merchant, Antonio Barezzi of Busseto. At Barezzi’s expense, Verdi moved at the age of eighteen to Milan to study music. He was not considered sufficiently accomplished to be accepted into the Milan conservatory, and so he studied privately.
He was not considered sufficiently accomplished to be accepted into the Milan conservatory, and so he studied privately. While in Milan, Verdi began his first opera, Oberto. Verdi eventually returned to Busseto and married Barezzi’s daughter Margherita. Oberto was performed at La Scala, and Verdi was commissioned to write three more operas. While he was working on this commission, his wife and two children died within a span of 22 months. Distraught, Verdi completed the comic opera Un Giorno de Regno, which failed miserably at its premiere in 1840. His contempt for any sort of criticism, musical or personal, stems from these events. His third opera, Nabucco, was his first big hit. From the start he was more interested in human drama and emotions than in writing pretty, popular bel cantostyle music.
From the start he was more interested in human drama and emotions than in writing pretty, popular bel cantostyle music. He reached a creative plateau between 1851 and 1853 with the composition of Rigoletto, La Traviata, and Il Trovatore. Verdi’s inheritance consisted of an operatic world dominated by bel canto. Composers Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini were the great triumvirate of this world. The bel canto era was not unlike that which immediately preceded 117 the reforms of Metastasio, marked by a notable lack of dramatic integration of words and music. As we have discussed, the distinctive features of bel canto opera include compositional formulas that permit the rapid production of operas, as well as segmentation of the opera into the traditional divisions of recitative, aria, and ensemble.
By the time of the operas of 1851-1853, Verdi had gone a long way toward breaking the mold. Despite the fact that he was a brilliant tunesmith in the Italian tradition, Verdi’s operas are not formulaic, nor do they clearly reflect the divisions of recitative, aria, and ensemble. Arias and vocal ensembles are intermingled and move smoothly from one to the other in Verdi’s operas. The variety of vocal forms and singing techniques is extraordinary. An example is the opening of Act 1 from La Traviata. Although we can identify individual sections, the overall effect in La Traviata is one of continuous forward motion in terms of both music and dramatic action. Verdi does not stop the action for dry recitative.
Verdi does not stop the action for dry recitative. The orchestra plays continuously, providing accompaniment here, background there, whatever is needed. The characters and chorus interact with each other with stunning flexibility. In this way La Traviata is much closer to what we now call music drama. Verdi has not completely broken with the bel canto style, however. In terms of its vocal usage and the direct, popular nature of its melodies, La Traviata is still bel canto. By improving on bel canto, rather than completely discarding it, Verdi became the undisputed king of Italian opera. Giuseppi Verdi composed 26 operas over the course of his long career. The Teaching Company Collection.
Giuseppi Verdi composed 26 operas over the course of his long career. The Teaching Company Collection. 118 Lectures 19-22: Verdi and Otello Against the backdrop of the 19th century, a literary age, Verdi as a dramatist sought ever-greater dramatic continuity in his operas. To this end, he used the technique known as parlante, a technique in which the distinction between aria and recitative is eliminated. In parlante, recitative-like vocal parts are underlaid by a memorable and tuneful orchestral accompaniment. Verdi reduced the length of the traditional recitative and blended it into a more continuous texture with the use of the orchestra. This allowed for much greater musical (and dramatic) continuity. It situated musical interest in the orchestra and the dramatic interest in the voices.
This allowed for much greater musical (and dramatic) continuity. It situated musical interest in the orchestra and the dramatic interest in the voices. A good musical example is in Rigoletto, Act 1, scene 7. Lyricism is the key to Verdi’s art. Verdi’s melodies never lost their direct and popular touch, and they are molded to the characters who sing them. An example of this is “La donna è mobile,” the Duke of Mantua’s aria from Act 4 of Rigoletto. Verdi was an admirer of Beethoven’s use of motivic development, and he used the same technique in his operas. He also used what is known as a hinge theme. This is a theme that becomes associated with some element in the dramatic action and reappears in the course of the opera to connect large areas of the drama.
This is a theme that becomes associated with some element in the dramatic action and reappears in the course of the opera to connect large areas of the drama. Verdi’s mature operas share several characteristics. First, human emotions and psychological insight provide the basis for the story lines. Second, the bel canto divisions of recitative and aria are increasingly deemphasized in favor of musical continuity. Third, the orchestra plays a key dramatic role, and fourth, the libretti used are of high quality and are based on high-quality literature. Otello (1886) developed out of a lengthy period of creative gestation for Verdi. This period started with the premiere of Aida in 1871, upon which Verdi retired from the opera.
This period started with the premiere of Aida in 1871, upon which Verdi retired from the opera. Subsequently, four people close to him (his wife, his publisher, a conductor, and composer/librettist Arrigo Boito) conspired to bring him out of retirement. In July 1879, Verdi received a proposal to write an opera based on Shakespeare’s Othello, with Boito as librettist. He completed this new opera in 1886. 119 In thinking about the Otello libretto, it is helpful to know that people in the 19th century, including, of course, Verdi, were fascinated by the plays of Shakespeare, whose extraordinary insights into the human condition and relationships appealed tremendously to the emotional and literary spirit of the age. Boito’s libretto of Otello is a masterpiece of reduction and distillation.
Boito’s libretto of Otello is a masterpiece of reduction and distillation. Ultimately, as in any opera, it was up to Verdi to flesh out the characters and dramatic situations that Boito, as librettist, had to abbreviate. The libretto/opera is in four acts. Act 1 presents Otello as a hero, Act 2 presents Otello in doubt, Act 3 reveals Otello’s degradation, and Act 4 brings about Otello’s destruction. From the standpoint of characterization, it is notable that two of the three main characters are polar opposites. Desdemona, Otello’s wife, is good incarnate, while Iago, Otello’s sergeant, is evil incarnate.
Desdemona, Otello’s wife, is good incarnate, while Iago, Otello’s sergeant, is evil incarnate. Otello is the man in the middle, whose journey from good to evil, from control to chaos, is the essential dramatic line of the play/opera. In Act 1, the orchestra plays an extraordinary role in setting the stormy, symbolic opening scene. Otello’s entrance is one of the most magnificent in all of opera. Verdi manages a huge number of musical forces in this unique scene. We hear a wide variety of choruses along with solos, all interacting with each other. Also in this act, Iago and Roderigo are introduced. Iago’s music, with its singsong, mocking character, is descriptive of his derision of women. Verdi’s music establishes the characters of Iago and Roderigo.
Verdi’s music establishes the characters of Iago and Roderigo. Iago soon begins to hatch part one of his plot, the downfall of Cassio. He makes sure Cassio has too much to drink. Cassio, as Iago plans, provokes a fight. Otello enters and strips Cassio of his rank. Otello has restored order In thinking about the Otello libretto, it is helpful to know that people in the 19th century... were fascinated by the plays of Shakespeare, whose extraordinary insights... appealed tremendously to the emotional and literary spirit of the age. 120 Lectures 19-22: Verdi and Otello but has lost his friend in doing so. A good musical example of this part of the opera is “Va al porto...” through Iago’s explanation.
A good musical example of this part of the opera is “Va al porto...” through Iago’s explanation. The transcendent love of Otello and Desdemona is revealed in a duet. This love duet establishes Desdemona’s character, and the “kiss” theme at its conclusion becomes a hinge theme that will return with a powerful impact at the end of the opera. Act 2 of the opera truly belongs to Iago. The opening orchestral prelude begins with a violent, slimy figure that characterizes Iago, who persuades Cassio to ask Desdemona to intercede for him in obtaining Otello’s pardon. Iago’s credo is the most amazing aria in the whole opera. The orchestral introduction in F minor sets the mood of evil. Orchestral “infernal” dances play between Iago’s verses.
The orchestral introduction in F minor sets the mood of evil. Orchestral “infernal” dances play between Iago’s verses. His credo is almost a huge recitative, rather than an aria, which would be out of character for him. He is the archetype of evil incarnate. We know now that Otello does not have a chance against him; Iago is in control. Iago goes to work on Otello. He sows the seeds of jealous suspicion in Otello as they watch Cassio and Desdemona talking together. A musical example of this is “Ciò m’accora” through “può affermate il sospetto.” Iago’s poison spreads. Why is Otello reacting so quickly? Otello is an outsider, thirty years older than his bride and of a different race.
Why is Otello reacting so quickly? Otello is an outsider, thirty years older than his bride and of a different race. As a result, it does not take much to unnerve him. Iago goads Otello to increased fury with lies about Cassio talking in his sleep about his love for Desdemona. The orchestra reflects Otello’s fury. Otello demands proof, and Iago tells him it exists in the form of the handkerchief that Otello once gave Desdemona. Iago assures Otello that Cassio now possesses this handkerchief. Otello is now completely blind with jealously and rage. These events are conveyed from “Pace, signor” through “Ah! sangue! sangue! sangue!” Iago and Otello join forces. Their duet of revenge ends Act 2.
sangue! sangue! sangue!” Iago and Otello join forces. Their duet of revenge ends Act 2. The orchestra plays a chilling passage, “Sì, pel ciel,” evocative of a descent into hell. 121 Act 3 is about Iago’s careful machinations to convince Otello beyond a shadow of a doubt that Desdemona is unfaithful to him. Otello’s rage is murderous and uncontrollable. Act 4 is about Desdemona, who is sixteen or seventeen years old and living in a land far from her home. Her husband has gone quite mad for reasons she does not understand. Her character is fleshed out in these moments before her death. She sings of lost love in The Willow Song. Otello’s enters Desdemona’s bedroom.
She sings of lost love in The Willow Song. Otello’s enters Desdemona’s bedroom. From this moment on, the opera moves very swiftly to the final catastrophe. Otello realizes too late that Desdemona was innocent, and, in reaction to this understanding, he kills himself. The kiss theme returns to heighten the pathos. A musical example is the conclusion of the opera from “Pria d’ucciderti.” Verdi conceived Otello as an intimate drama, not as a spectacle. The premiere of this work was probably the greatest operatic triumph of all time.
The premiere of this work was probably the greatest operatic triumph of all time. ■ 122 Lectures 23 and 24: French Opera French Opera Lectures 23 and 24 The point of this survey [of French opera] is threefold: to give us an overview of the circumstances surrounding the evolution of a distinctly French operatic style... to give us an idea of why and how French opera is different from Italian opera... and... to remind us that operatic content... is most often a function of the language... and the politics and economic class of its consumers. F rench-language opera came into being in 1669, a late start compared to that of Italian opera. The comparatively late development of French opera has much to do with the nature of the French language and the French spirit.
The comparatively late development of French opera has much to do with the nature of the French language and the French spirit. The French language is not as well suited to a melismatic operatic singing style as the Italian language. Also, the French preferred their drama pure, in the theater, and unsullied by music, and they regarded theatrical music as an accompaniment to their favorite stage spectacle, ballet. Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687) is almost singularly responsible for creating a French language operatic tradition. Italian by birth, Lully was a dancer and musician by training. He came to Paris at the age of fourteen. He quickly developed into a first-rate conductor and composer, and, through equal parts talent and scheming, he eventually became master of all music at the court of Louis XIV.
Lully’s operas incorporated elements from musical and dramatic genres already popular in France, including French classical dramatic literature; huge, dramatic stage sets and machinery; and ballet. Staged professional dance had been popular entertainment in France since the 16th century, and Louis XIV fancied himself a dancer and was a tremendous patron of dance. Lully realized from the start that if opera was to become popular in France, it must contain a great amount of dance. Lully created a French national style of opera that encompassed magnificence, tragic drama, and dance. His operas are in five acts with a prologue devoted 123 to the glorification of Louis XIV. In these operas, the action unrolls with majestic indifference to realism and involves all kinds of improbable adventures. Characters engage in extended discourse on love and honor. Also, there are rarely any comic characters.
Characters engage in extended discourse on love and honor. Also, there are rarely any comic characters. Everything is stately, formal, and detached from reality. Lully’s greatest operatic contribution was his design of a recitative style suited to the long vowels and soft consonants of the French language. He claimed that his model was spoken drama. His recitatives are syllabic, with one pitch per syllable. The flexibility of the French language is reflected in the continuous changes of meter in these recitatives, which also fall into melodic patterns. (Italian recitatives do not have melodic patterns. They just keep on developing; they are “through composed.”) In contrast to Italian arias, Lully’s arias tend to be short and limited in vocal range, and they emphasize clear enunciation and textural clarity over vocal acrobatics.
They generally do not stand alone as musical numbers, but tend to be merged with longer musical sequences. Also, they are not the essential events in the opera, and they do not use coloratura effects. Instead, they employ a vocal style that demanded less virtuosity from singers than the more florid style of Italian opera. A good musical example is the recitative/ monologue from Lully’s Armide (1686). Lully established opera as an institution of the state. The dignified, formal splendor of his operas embodied the glorious age of Louis XIV. Their disadvantage is that, once the age of Louis XIV passed, these operas sounded empty and pompous. Their advantage is that they provided the foundation for generations of French and French-based opera composers. Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) was the foremost French musician of the 18th century.
Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) was the foremost French musician of the 18th century. He saw himself as the inheritor of a great and majestic tradition. We will begin by considering his opera Hippolyte et Aricie (1733). This opera is Rameau’s first. Like the operas of Lully and other French composers, Rameau’s operas display much less contrast between aria and recitative than contemporary Italian operas. A musical example of this is “Ah! faut-il” from Act 4, scene 1 of Hippolyte et Aricie. 124 Lectures 23 and 24: French Opera Rameau’s operas were also controversial. The operatic traditionalists, or Lullists, found Rameau’s operas too Italian and, as such, musically subversive.
The operatic traditionalists, or Lullists, found Rameau’s operas too Italian and, as such, musically subversive. The operatic progressives on the other hand felt that Rameau was the savior of an operatic tradition that had grown tired and stale with age. French opera is, unfortunately, rarely heard outside France, because it is tailored to particular French tastes. Rameau’s music is, however, first rate and worth seeking out. Within twenty years the controversy over Rameau’s music had shifted 180 degrees. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) and his followers rejected traditional French opera and embraced the new Italian comic genre as an example of opera appropriate to the Enlightenment. Rameau’s operas became the tradition against which the new Enlightenment progressives rebelled.
Rameau’s operas became the tradition against which the new Enlightenment progressives rebelled. Rousseau, among his other talents, was a composer (of sorts). In 1752, inspired by Italian opera buffa, he wrote Le Devin du village (The Village Soothsayer). This work is very close to the popular French tradition of opéra comique. Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787) was by nature a reformer; he effected a synthesis of elements of the new Italian opera and of traditional French opera. Though he worked across Europe, Gluck’s greatest fame was achieved in Paris under the patronage of the Austrian-born French queen Marie Antoinette. A musical example is from Act 2, scene 1 of Orfeo ed Euridice.
A musical example is from Act 2, scene 1 of Orfeo ed Euridice. The two major influences on Gluck’s work were his growing familiarity with traditional French opera and the spirit of the Enlightenment. In operatic terms this translated into an artistic goal of a non-formulaic, simple, unaffected expression of human feelings. In practical terms this meant that Gluck had to reign in his singers! In Orfeo ed Euridice...the arias are melodically simple and emotionally direct. The recitatives have a very high melodic content, irregular phrase structures, and rhythmic flexibility. 125 In Orfeo ed Euridice, Gluck’s version of the story of Orpheus, the arias are melodically simple and emotionally direct. The recitatives have a very high melodic content, irregular phrase structures and rhythmic flexibility.
The recitatives have a very high melodic content, irregular phrase structures and rhythmic flexibility. Everything is accompanied. Dance, hitherto a secondary element, is now integral to the action. Also, Gluck relies heavily on a chorus. This is uniquely French. The high degree of integration of dance, chorus, and solos is noteworthy. As a musical example we will consider Act 2, scene 1 of Orfeo ed Euridice. Gluck’s operas became a model for the next generation of French composers. They proved that it was possible to maintain the great tradition of French operatic pomp and magnificence while adhering to the spirit and new melodic naturalness of the Enlightenment. In the first half of the 19th century, Paris became the operatic capital of Europe.
In the first half of the 19th century, Paris became the operatic capital of Europe. In typical French operatic tradition, early-19th-century French opera celebrated heroic figures, heightened dramatic situations, and magnificence. By the 1820s French grand opera had come into being. As royal patronage dwindled, opera increasingly became a middle-class entertainment to which the spectacular and dramatically obvious grand operas were designed to appeal. These operas indulged the French taste for grand spectacles and crowd scenes with lots of characters all singing at the same time. Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791-1864) almost singlehandedly established French grand opera. Born in Berlin as Jakob Liebmann Beer, he composed operas in both German and Italian before moving to France, where he earned fame and fortune.
His operas have fallen into almost total obscurity. They were intended as popular entertainment and lack the musical and dramatic substance necessary to remain in the repertory. Nevertheless, Meyerbeer was particularly famous (and imitated widely) for his ability to manage large numbers of singers, dancers, and Giacomo Meyerbeer, now obscure, was admired and often imitated in his own day. Library of Congress, Music Division. 126 Lectures 23 and 24: French Opera choristers on stage. A good musical example is the conclusion of Act 2 from Les Huguenots. A development in tandem with grand opera was opéra comique. This type of opera employed spoken dialogue rather than recitative, and it featured somewhat less pretentious productions than grand opera.
This type of opera employed spoken dialogue rather than recitative, and it featured somewhat less pretentious productions than grand opera. Composers of opéra comique included Jacques Offenbach, whose operas are still performed today. Lyric opera, another form that developed in France, represents a sort of halfway point between grand opera and opéra comique. Like opéra comique, lyric opera often uses spoken dialogue and directly appealing melodies. Like grand opera, lyric opera tends toward grandiosity. Included in this classification are Charles Gounod’s Faust and Romeo and Juliet, Camille Saint-Saens’ Samson and Delilah, and Georges Bizet’s (1838-1875) Carmen (1875). Carmen is one of the best-known lyric operas, its form combining elements of grand opera and opéra comique.
Carmen is one of the best-known lyric operas, its form combining elements of grand opera and opéra comique. Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-23409. 127 Carmen remains one of the most beloved and frequently performed and adapted operas in the repertory. Its composer, Bizet, lived a short and unhappy life. He died nearly penniless three months after the premiere of Carmen. Carmen is about two very different people and their mutual destruction. It is a frank and powerful look at the brutal and transformational power of sex and desire, violence and fate. The titular character Carmen is the embodiment of temptation and primal, destructive sexuality. Don Jose is destroyed by his own sexuality, unleashed and set aflame by Carmen.
Don Jose is destroyed by his own sexuality, unleashed and set aflame by Carmen. The card scene in Act 2 of Carmen is an example of operatic drama at its most powerful. In this scene Carmen no longer finds Don Jose sexually appealing and tells him so. She makes it clear that she has no intention of being dominated by any man. Two of Carmen’s friends are telling each other’s fortunes with a deck of cards. Carmen joins them. She reads death in the cards. The musical motive associated with Carmen’s ultimate fate is heard as she turns over the cards. While her two friends sing their cheerful refrains, Carmen sings her fatalistic aria. Her acceptance of her fate imbues her with tragic beauty. As a musical example, we will consider the card trio from Act 2 of Carmen. ■ 128 Lectures 23 and 24:

as an internationally-recognized genre of opera distinct then from the Italian and French operas we have studied, came into being in 1791 with... Mozart’s The Magic Flute. By comparison, Italian opera came into being in 1600... perhaps even earlier.... A distinctly French opera came into being in 1669.... Why did it take so long for a distinctly German operatic school to evolve? T he late development of German opera had much to do with the nature both of the German artistic/intellectual class and of the German language. True German opera-in terms of singing style and the type of stories set to music-evolved from native German roots. To understand the development of opera in different nations, it is useful to think about how language defines operatic style. For example, the Italian language lends itself to song.
For example, the Italian language lends itself to song. It is full of long, round vowels evenly interspersed with clean consonants that perfectly suit the melismatic/ coloratura character of traditional Italian opera. In contrast, the French language does not have the clean consonants of Italian. Much less suited to coloratura, French lends itself better to the declamatory style developed by Lully. German on the other hand is a language dominated by consonants. The melismatic, vowel-dominated Italian singing style is not suited to German. Rather, German lends itself to syllabic style: one syllable per pitch. One type of musical performance from which German opera arose is singspiel. Singspiel literally means “sing-play” or “play with singing.” It is understood today is a partly sung, partly spoken German theatrical genre that had its roots in popular culture.
The equivalent type of genre is England is called a ballad opera or operetta; in France it is opéra comique; in the U.S.A. it is a musical; in Italy there is no equivalent since all opera is sung. Mozart’s singspiel The Rescue from the Harem (1782) elevated a popular genre to the level of high art at a single stroke. 184 Lecture 25: German Opera Comes of Age The Magic Flute, both singspiel and opera, was the last major work Mozart completed before his death. It was commissioned by librettist/director/ actor Emanuel Schikeneder for performance at a burgtheater, a type of music hall offering lower-middle-class entertainment. Mozart was working within a German tradition, but the tradition becomes operatic in his hands.
Mozart was working within a German tradition, but the tradition becomes operatic in his hands. The Magic Flute is half fairy-tale, filled with strange exotic people, beings, events, and locales, and half morality play about Masonic initiation ritual and Enlightenment ideals. Its music is brilliant and popular, highly memorable, and imbued with a folklike directness. A musical example is “Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja.” It is easy to see German opera’s roots in singspiel. German operatic melodies are well suited to the features of the German language, and spoken dialogue replaces dry recitative. Arias are simple in form; melodies are repeated and non-melismatic. Plots and story lines draw on German folktales with their supernatural characters and situations.
Plots and story lines draw on German folktales with their supernatural characters and situations. Lacking a long, commercially profitable tradition, 19th-century German opera became an experimental genre. Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz (1821) is the definitive work that established 19th-century German opera. It exemplifies many of the characteristics of German operas from this century: Plots are drawn from medieval history, legend, or fairy-tale; stories typically include supernatural beings and happenings and stress wild, mysterious, and uncontrolled nature; supernatural incidents are essential plot elements; human characters often become the agents of supernatural forces; and the triumph of good over evil is often interpreted in terms of salvation or redemption. The Magic Flute... was the last major work Mozart completed before his death.
The Magic Flute... was the last major work Mozart completed before his death. It was commissioned by... Emanuel Schikeneder for performance at a burgtheater, a type of music hall offering lowermiddle-class entertainment. 185 Der Freischütz is one of the most influential operas of the 19th century. The famous Wolf’s Glen Scene is a brilliant depiction of supernatural horror, completely different from contemporary Italian bel canto opera and French grand and lyric opera in terms of the pervasive use of spoken dialogue, expressive content, and compositional technique. The content of background music is very strong and essential to the drama.

Ordinarily we associate this sort of artistic originality and power with... someone whose humanity and spirit reflect the high artistic goals for which they strive. Not Wagner. He was, frankly, one of the most repellent human beings who ever lived. This troubles and disappoints us. W agner (1813-1883) was megalomaniacal, ruthless, hedonistic, arrogant, and racist. His anti-Semitism and cries for racial purity approached madness.
His anti-Semitism and cries for racial purity approached madness. Many writers have speculated that his meanness sprang from an extraordinary insecurity based, in part, on his own unclear paternity. He demanded from society an unprecedented level of attention and luxury, to the point that one modern critic, Harold Schonberg, states that Wagner actually thought himself a god. Wagner was born in Leipzig in 1813. His legal father was Carl Friedrich Wagner, although his biological father may have been Ludwig Geyer, an actor and painter with whom his mother was having an affair and who was rumored to have been Jewish. Wagner was obsessed with the question of his paternity. Carl Wagner died when Richard was seven months old. Within a year his mother married Ludwig Geyer, who himself died seven years later. At fourteen Richard stopped calling himself Geyer and began using the name Wagner.
Within a year his mother married Ludwig Geyer, who himself died seven years later. At fourteen Richard stopped calling himself Geyer and began using the name Wagner. At fifteen he decided to become a composer, despite the fact that he could hardly play an instrument and knew next to nothing about the mechanics of music. In terms of musical training, Wagner was an extraordinarily late bloomer. His two great musical influences were Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and Weber’s Der Freischütz. Almost from the beginning, he wanted to write operas. He wrote his own libretti and controlled every aspect of his operas from stage design to direction. He wrote/composed thirteen complete operas. His early works were based on Italian, French, and German models. 187 Wagner’s revolutionary political activism in Germany in 1848 and 1849 drove him into Swiss exile for nearly 10 years.
187 Wagner’s revolutionary political activism in Germany in 1848 and 1849 drove him into Swiss exile for nearly 10 years. While in Switzerland, he took a six-year break from composing, during which he reevaluated his career and the nature of the music he wanted to write. He had already concluded that both Italian and French opera were degenerate art forms. He wrote a series of treatises and essays that laid out his beliefs and new aesthetic doctrines. Like the Florentine Camerata, Wagner went back to ancient Greek drama for inspiration. He believed that Greek drama was superior for five reasons: * It represented a successful combination of the arts. * It took its subject matter from myth that illuminates human experience to the depths and in universal terms. * Both the content and the occasion of the performance had religious significance. * It was a religion of the purely human.
* Both the content and the occasion of the performance had religious significance. * It was a religion of the purely human. * The entire community took part. Wagner was convinced that an artistic revolution was called for, in which all the resources of drama poetry, instrumental music, song, acting, gesture, costume, and scenery would be combined in the theatrical presentation of myth. He called his projected, all-encompassing music dramas Gesamtkunstwerk, the all-inclusive art form. A key to the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk was the orchestra, which had to perform for Wagner the same function as the chorus in a Greek drama. To achieve this orchestral/ instrumental independence, Wagner invented the concept of leitmotif. A leitmotif is a musical motive associated with a particular person, thing, or dramatic idea.
A leitmotif is a musical motive associated with a particular person, thing, or dramatic idea. Musical examples include drink/death and desire leitmotifs from Tristan und Isolde. Leitmotifs are repeated, altered, fragmented, and developed, often in the voices, but more often in the orchestra. Each permutation offers some new and subtle twist on its meaning; it serves to underpin the truth. In Wagner’s music dramas the orchestra is no longer 188 Lectures 26 and 27: Richard Wagner and Tristan und Isolde just an accompaniment to the voices. It becomes a full partner with everything onstage. Wagner would not have formulated many of his theories about music drama if he had not studied Arthur Schopenhauer’s book The World as Will and Representation (1818).
Schopenhauer (1788-1860) was a German philosopher. Wagner discovered Schopenhauer and his book around 1854. It was the most important intellectual event of Wagner’s life. Schopenhauer wrote that instrumental music alone was capable of expressing the deepest, most primal human thoughts and emotions. This inspired Wagner to develop the concept of leitmotif. A Wagnerian music drama unfolds on two different levels. The singers onstage present the world of human emotions, replete with the half-truths, delusions, and dishonesty that characterize conscious interaction. The orchestra reveals the unspoken truth. Wagner was also deeply affected by Schopenhauer’s view that only through total negation and death could salvation and transcendence be achieved. Tristan und Isolde (1859) exemplifies the quintessence of Wagner’s mature style.
Tristan und Isolde (1859) exemplifies the quintessence of Wagner’s mature style. Aside from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, Tristan und Isolde is the most influential composition (not just opera) of the 19th century. It is a musical expression of Schopenhauer’s doctrine that existence is an inherently insatiable web of longings, willings, and strivings from which the only permanent liberation is the cessation of being. The opera’s prelude (overture) predicts the action to come. It is based on the drink/death and desire leitmotifs. The drink/death leitmotif is composed of an upward motive representing the physical action of raising the goblet of wine and a descending motive symbolic of death. It is performed together with a rising motive that does not resolve, symbolic of unfulfilled desire.
It is performed together with a rising motive that does not resolve, symbolic of unfulfilled desire. The two leitmotifs are mirror images of each other: love/death and death/love, the underlying meaning being that, for Tristan and Isolde, love and death are connected. While in Switzerland, [Wagner] took a six-year break from composing, during which he reevaluated his career and the nature of the music he wanted to write. 189 The prelude is slow. It has no tonal center. It consists of one deceptive (unresolved) cadence after another, interspersed with long, pregnant pauses. All of this creates tension, and in doing so it prepares us for a story of unfulfilled emotional and sexual passion. The whole opera is, in many ways, one gigantic deceptive cadence after another!
The whole opera is, in many ways, one gigantic deceptive cadence after another! Tristan und Isolde is in three acts. Act 1 centers on the drinking of the love potion, Act 2 on the mortal wounding of Tristan, and Act 3 on the deaths of Tristan and Isolde. In Act 3, Isolde holds the dying Tristan in her arms and sings her transcendent liebestod (love/death) aria. It represents the moment at which Tristan and Isolde’s unconsummated passion transcends to realization at a higher plane. With the liebestod aria Wagner’s music must be, and is, as transcendent as the new reality that Isolde is already seeing as she approaches her death. Wagner was a paradox, representing the best and worst of human attributes.
Wagner was a paradox, representing the best and worst of human attributes. His music provoked huge controversy and created pro- and anti-Wagnerian cults. He changed music forever. ■ 190 Lecture 28: Late Romantic German Opera-Richard Strauss and Salome Late Romantic German OperaRichard Strauss and Salome Lecture 28 In his time, Richard Strauss was hailed as Wagner’s successor.... Unlike Wagner, though, Strauss came to opera... relatively late in his compositional career. Strauss spent the first part of his career writing a series of extraordinary tone poems, purely orchestral works, which in reality functioned like instrumental operas in that each one of these tone poems tells a specific story and invokes explicit visual imagery. We should think of these tone poems as operas without words.
We should think of these tone poems as operas without words. R ichard Strauss’s (1864-1949) three greatest operas are Salome (1905), Elektra (1909), and Der Rosenkavalier (1911). Strauss was born in Munich in 1864. His father, Franz Strauss, was the most famous French horn player in Germany. Franz Strauss was a musical archconservative and anti-Wagnerian who gave his son the best and most conservative musical education his money and connections could buy. Franz saw to it that Richard received training as a pianist, violinist, conductor, and composer. Richard’s classically oriented compositional technique disintegrated with his eventual (and inevitable) exposure to the music of Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, and Richard Wagner. Fame came rapidly to Strauss.
Fame came rapidly to Strauss. For a fascinated and star-hungry public, he inherited the mantle of Liszt and Wagner as a shocking modern composer and performer. The Strauss craze reached its peak in 1905 with the premiere of Salome, one of the most controversial operas of all time. The story of Salome comes from Matthew 14:6-11, which tells of the execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas at the request of Herod’s stepdaughter, the princess Salome. Oscar Wilde was fascinated by the story of Salome and wrote a play based on it that appeared in 1892. Wilde’s Salome is filled with a degree of eroticism, intrigue, and sexuality that is light years beyond the biblical account.
Wilde’s Salome is filled with a degree of eroticism, intrigue, and sexuality that is light years beyond the biblical account. Strauss sliced and diced a German translation of Wilde’s play to his own specifications, completing his opera in 1905. 191 Strauss’s Salome takes place on a terrace next to the banquet hall in the palace of Herod, circa 30-31 C.E. In his opera, Salome is a beautiful, sexually aware vixen of sixteen. Her character is depicted in her music. Salome is intrigued by the voice of John the Baptist, who is being held prisoner in a cistern next to the terrace. She has John brought out. His music is almost heroic and lacks the harmonic complexities that fill Salome’s music.
She has John brought out. His music is almost heroic and lacks the harmonic complexities that fill Salome’s music. An example of this is John’s entrance, “Wo ist er...” Salome is both repelled by and profoundly attracted to John. Her attempts to ingratiate herself to him are met with scorn. A drunken Herod, dangerously enamored of his stepdaughter, asks Salome to dance for him, and he promises her anything if she does. Her price for the dance is the head of John the Baptist. Terrified, Herod finally agrees to her demand. Salome embraces and kisses the severed head of John the Baptist. In horror Herod orders Salome killed. A musical example is the conclusion of the opera from “Sie ist ein Ungeheuer, deine Tochter” (“She is a monster, your daughter”).
Salome is a veritable textbook of psychopathology. Within two years of its premiere, it had been performed in over fifty cities. Though many considered it pornographic, Salome is first and foremost a representative, from the world of opera, of the experimental, post-Victorian turn of the century. ■ Strauss sliced and diced a German translation of [Oscar] Wilde’s play to his own specifications, completing his opera in 1905. 192 Lectures 29 and 30: Russian Opera Russian Opera Lectures 29 and 30 Their lack of schooling in traditional music theory forced The Five to discover their own way of doing things, and in the process, they called on the materials closest at hand, which were, my friends, folk songs.
Their frequent use of actual or imitated folk material for generating themes in a work has literary parallels in the borrowings by Pushkin and Gogol. T he rise of cultivated Russian music had much to do with the rise of nationalism in the 19th century. The French Revolution of 1789 was a highly exportable model in an increasingly enlightened, middle-class Europe. In 1848 insurrections broke out across Europe, all of them eventually quelled by the ruling powers. Art replaced outlawed political activism as a mode of nationalistic self-expression. An example is the rise of musical nationalism, which characteristically incorporated actual folk music or folk-like music into the concert works and operas of Italian/non-German composers. Russian musical nationalism was a reaction less to the events of 1848 than to Russia’s fear of foreign influences.
Russian musical nationalism was a reaction less to the events of 1848 than to Russia’s fear of foreign influences. The development of concert music in Russia was dependent on the tastes of the aristocracy living in St. Petersburg. Until the 19th century, cultivated music in St. Petersburg consisted of Italian opera, light Viennese and Italian instrumental music, and aristocratic amateur concerts. Russia “emerged” and became part of the greater European community as a result of Napoleon’s defeat in 1812 and the Decembrist Revolt of 1825. The spirit of individual freedom and nationalism that powered the Decembrist Revolt was felt throughout the intellectual and artistic classes. In and around 1825 certain Russian writers, poets, and musicians tried to cultivate a uniquely Russian artistic tradition.
In and around 1825 certain Russian writers, poets, and musicians tried to cultivate a uniquely Russian artistic tradition. Preeminent among these Russian nationalists was the poet and author Alexander Pushkin (17991837). Pushkin was a Lord Byron-inspired individualistic/nationalistic 193 rabble-rouser. He elevated the literary perception of the Russian language through the model of his own works. Among his works that were turned into operas are Eugene Onegin (Tchaikovsky), Queen of Spades (Tchaikovsky), Boris Godunov (Mussorgsky), and Ruslan and Lyudmila (Glinka). The history of Russian musical nationalism and opera began with Mikhail Glinka (1804-1857). Glinka was born into a wealthy family and received the piano and violin lessons typical for someone of his class.
Glinka was born into a wealthy family and received the piano and violin lessons typical for someone of his class. At age 20 he became a civil servant, working in the Ministry of Ways and Communication in St. Petersburg. In 1834, inspired by Pushkin and Gogol, Glinka decided to compose an opera in the Russian language on a Russian subject-A Life for the Czar. After his death in 1857 Glinka was canonized and deified as the father of Russian music. Ruslan and Lyudmila (1842) is generally considered Glinka’s masterpiece. Glinka’s score is filled with the sort of folk-inspired melodies, orientalisms, rhythmic irregularities, and orchestral effects that we have since come to associate with Russian music. A musical example is the overture to Ruslan and Lyudmila.
A musical example is the overture to Ruslan and Lyudmila. The story of the opera is a fairy-tale about Ruslan and Lyudmila, two young aristocrats who are in love, and the sinister forces that separate them. Near the beginning of the opera, a chorus predicts the dramatic action. This choral music exemplifies the Russian style. Its main features are as follows: * Melodies are clearly folk-like and Slavic-sounding. * Dance rhythms are asymmetrical. The accents are not grouped in twos or threes as they are in Western music. They fall into unequal groupings, with accents falling all over the place. In this chorus we have groupings of five (so-called additive meter, where groupings of two and three beats are played in succession to add up to five). * The chorus sings in unison harmonies.
* The chorus sings in unison harmonies. * The word setting is syllabic. A musical example is Act 1, chorus. 194 Lectures 29 and 30: Russian Opera Among Lyudmila’s three suitors is the evil Farlaf, a sort of opera buffa bad guy. This is communicated through his patter aria (in rondo form). Ruslan, typical of Russian heroes, is a low voice, in this case a bass/baritone. His grief at finding his beloved Lyudmila in a coma-like sleep is expressed in the aria “O love of my life.” Following the death of Glinka in 1857, composer and teacher Mili Balakirev (1837-1910) quickly became the czar of Russian music. He gathered around him four young amateur composers (they all had other quite different professions).
He gathered around him four young amateur composers (they all had other quite different professions). They came to be known, along with Balakirev, as The Five. This group included Cesar Cui, an army engineer (1835-1918); Modest Mussorgsky, an army officer (1839-1881); Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a naval officer (1844-1908); and Aleksander Borodin, a scientist (1833-1887). To a great degree The Five were self-taught. Essential to their musical development was the belief that their duty was to create a Russian national music based on the characteristics of Russian folk music and the Russian language. A characteristically Russian music emerged from The Five. The pieces that they created share the following features: * They utilize Russian folk melodies or folk-like melodies as the essential thematic material.
The pieces that they created share the following features: * They utilize Russian folk melodies or folk-like melodies as the essential thematic material. * They are essentially thematic, with minimal development in the German sense. * They are expressively powerful, lyric music that is often, to the Western ears, emotionally unrefined. Mussorgsky was the first of The Five to mature compositionally. Depression and alcohol led to his early death. He was known for only a handful of works, including his masterwork, the opera Boris Godunov. 195 There are six different versions of [Boris Godunov]. The most commonly heard version is one prepared by Mussorgsky’s friend Rimsky-Korsakov after Mussorgsky’s death. The story of Boris Godunov takes place between 1598 and 1605 and is based on historical events.
The story of Boris Godunov takes place between 1598 and 1605 and is based on historical events. There are six different versions of the opera. The most commonly heard version is one prepared by Mussorgsky’s friend Rimsky-Korsakov after Mussorgsky’s death. Boris Godunov consists of a prologue plus four acts. It is actually a series of set pieces, or tableaus, and it is based on a dramatic chronicle by Pushkin. Mussorgsky himself wrote the libretto, central to which are two issues: the relationship between ruler and ruled and the corrupting influence of power. No composer ever portrayed the peasant class as sympathetically as Mussorgsky does in Boris Godunov. Critical to this sympathetic portrayal is Mussorgsky’s extraordinary reproduction of Russian speech patterns in music.
Critical to this sympathetic portrayal is Mussorgsky’s extraordinary reproduction of Russian speech patterns in music. A musical example is the prologue, scene 2, Boris’ ascension to the throne. We are introduced to Varlaam, a drunken priest, whose language and manner is only a step removed from the peasant class. A musical example of this introduction is Varlaam’s song. The death of Boris is as profound and moving as any moment in opera. The old divisions of recitative and aria are virtually nonexistent. Recitative-like music is always accompanied by the orchestra. A musical example is the death of Boris in Act 4, scene 2. Boris Godunov is the pinnacle of 19th-century Russian opera, a tradition only 38 years before Boris with Glinka’s A Life for the Czar.
The latter opera is what Otello, Tristan und Isolde, and Carmen are to 19th-century Italian, German, and French opera respectively: the culmination of what had come before and a difficult, if not impossible, act to follow. ■ 196 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca Lectures 31 and 32 The great operatic exponent of Italian verismo opera was Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini.
According to Robert Donington, “Puccini is much the best of verismo and Tosca may well be the best of Puccini.”... Not long before he died, Puccini wrote to a friend, “Almighty God touched me with his little finger and said, ‘Write for the theater, mind, only for the theater,’ and I have obeyed that supreme command.” V erismo (truth) opera grew out of the 19th-century philosophical movements of positivism and naturalism. Positivism posits that the only reality that humankind should concern itself with is observable fact; there are no mysteries left in the world that science cannot explain. An offshoot of positivism is naturalism: the study of human relations.
An offshoot of positivism is naturalism: the study of human relations. Realist/ verismo authors and composers tend to depict the worlds of the criminal, the dispossessed, and the demoralized for their emotional extremes and for their absence of pose and artifice. Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924) was the greatest composer of verismo operas. Primarily a man of the theater, he wrote 12 operas, 3 of which remain among the most popular in the repertory: Tosca, La Bohème, and Madame Butterfly. Puccini was born in Lucca in 1858, the last in a five-generation line of respected musicians. He studied at the Milan Conservatory with Amilcare Ponchielli. His first huge success was La Bohème of 1896.

Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-USZ62-33075. 197 Puccini was not an innovator. As a composer he was not controversial. Unlike Verdi, Puccini did not constantly evolve, seeking ever-greater drama and movement in his operas. He was, however, a superb and sympathetic melodist, whose other compositional skills were brought to bear directly on the dramatic materials before him: stage action, impulsive feeling, and truth in expression-often exaggerated expression. Many important critics, composers, and music historians of today have dismissed Puccini as an artless hack.
Many important critics, composers, and music historians of today have dismissed Puccini as an artless hack. They have backed up their criticisms with sound arguments regarding Puccini’s compositional technique and the content and nature of his libretti. However, opera in Italy has almost always been a popular entertainment, and Puccini’s operas are very much part of this tradition. We will now examine Puccini’s Tosca (1900). The large outline of the story is based on historical events surrounding the “liberation” of Rome by Napoleonic forces around 1800. Act 1 introduces us to the characters. Mario Cavaradossi (tenor) is the hero and lover of Floria Tosca, a hot-blooded, beautiful opera singer. Cesare Angelotti is a nationalist and freedom-fighter who has just escaped from prison.
Cesare Angelotti is a nationalist and freedom-fighter who has just escaped from prison. Vitellio Scarpia is the evil and sadistic chief of the secret police. Act 2 is one of the greatest of all Puccini’s operatic acts and the focal point in this opera. Scarpia desires Tosca and will use her to find Angelotti. Scarpia’s aria (“Ella verrà...”) demonstrates effortless vocal lyricism at the expense of dramatic reality. Scarpia could sound more evil than he does. This is the kind of thing that has put Tosca under fire from critics. Also noteworthy is Puccini’s melding of parlante, arias, etc. into a continuous flow of music.
Also noteworthy is Puccini’s melding of parlante, arias, etc. into a continuous flow of music. A musical example is Act 2 from Scarpia’s “Tosca è un buon falco!” to the end of Scarpia’s aria, “Ella verrà...” Scarpia tries to discover where Angelotti is hiding by questioning Cavaradossi, who resists him. A musical example is “Ov’è Angelotti?” The questioning turns ugly, and thenTosca enters. In her presence, Scarpia has Cavaradossi tortured in an adjoining room. This scene of brutal torture is 198 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca unique in opera. Puccini piles on the agony to a climax of unbearable tension.
Puccini piles on the agony to a climax of unbearable tension. Its depiction of the worst of human behavior is typical of verismo. Tosca cannot bear her psychological torture any longer. She tells Scarpia where Angelotti is hiding. Scarpia orders the end of Cavaradossi’s torture. A musical example is the torture scene from Scarpia’s “Orsù, Tosca, parlate” to his “Portatelo qui.” Cavaradossi learns of Napoleon’s victory at Marengo. He revives and sings a victory song. Scarpia orders him to the gallows and forbids Tosca to accompany him.

Puccini continues to pile one climactic moment upon the next; please refer to the part of the opera from Cavaradossi’s “Vittoriá!” to Scarpia’s “Voi noi.” Tosca tries to negotiate for Cavaradossi’s life. Scarpia reveals that the price is Tosca herself. A musical example is the part of the opera from Tosca’s “Quanto?” through Scarpia’s “Già. Mi dicon venal.” Tosca is repelled and feels that God has abandoned her.
Mi dicon venal.” Tosca is repelled and feels that God has abandoned her. She sings one of Puccini’s most beloved and famous arias, “Vissi d’arte.” Tosca agrees to yield to Scarpia in exchange for Cavaradossi’s life and a safe-conduct pass. Scarpia appears to agree to her request. He writes the pass, but when he tries to embrace her, she plunges a knife into him and kills him. Please refer to the segment of the opera from Scarpia’s “Io tenni la promessa” to the end of the scene. Puccini’s operas exhibit a wonderful combination of words and music. His stories are dramatically compelling, and his balance of words and music heightens and deepens the dramatic meaning and expressive content.
His stories are dramatically compelling, and his balance of words and music heightens and deepens the dramatic meaning and expressive content. [Puccini’s] stories are dramatically compelling, and his balance of words and music heightens and deepens the dramatic meaning and expressive content. 199 We conclude the course with an examination of Richard Strauss’s last opera, Capriccio (1941). Capriccio takes place outside Paris around 1775, at a time when Gluck’s operatic reforms were raising a storm of discussion and controversy. It is an opera about opera, particularly about the relationship between words and music. In one scene a poet, composer, and a stage director argue the relative merits of their respective crafts. A musical example is scene 9 from Capriccio. Is opera words or music?
A musical example is scene 9 from Capriccio. Is opera words or music? It is neither one exclusively, but rather an indefinable combination of both. The whole is always greater than its constituent parts. ■ 200 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca 201 202 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca 203 204 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca 205 206 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca 207 208 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca 209 210 Lectures 31 and 32: Verismo, Puccini,

Bizet, Georges (183875): French opera composer famous for Carmen, his greatest work and the most popular opera of all time.
Bizet, Georges (183875): French opera composer famous for Carmen, his greatest work and the most popular opera of all time. A master dramatist, Bizet deftly establishes character and mood through his music. Boito, Arrigo (1842-1918): Italian librettist and composer. Boito’s libretti for Verdi’s Otello and Falstaff are considered among the greatest in all Italian opera. Da Ponte, Lorenzo (1749-1838): Italian librettist and poet. Da Ponte rose to the peak of his achievement with his libretti for Mozart’s operas The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and Così fan tutte. Caccini, Giulio (15511618): One of the earliest Italian opera composers and a member of the Florentine Camerata. Gesualdo, Carlo, Prince of Venosa (c.
Gesualdo, Carlo, Prince of Venosa (c. 1560-1613): Italian lutenist and composer, famous for his innovations of harmonic progressions and dissonance. Glinka, Mikhail (1804-1857): Russian composer regarded as the founder of Russian musical nationalism. His operatic masterpiece is Ruslan and Lyudmila of 1836. Gluck, Christoph Willibald (1714-1787): Major composer who effected a synthesis of elements of Italian opera and traditional French opera. Essential features of his operatic style include melodically simple and emotionally direct arias; recitatives that demonstrate a high melodic content; the use of dance as integral to the dramatic action; strong reliance on choruses, and a high degree of integration of dance, chorus and solos.
257 Hofmannsthal, Hugo von (1874-1929): Great Austrian librettist who wrote the libretti for many of Richard Strauss’s operas. Josquin des Prez (c. 1440-1521): Preeminent composer of the Renaissance who used both polyphonic and homophonic styles. His madrigals represent the Renaissance ideal of emotional and character expressivity. Leonin (Magister Leoninus) (c. 1135-c. 1201): Composer and poet of the Notre Dame school and greatest exponent of florid organum. Lully, Jean-Baptiste (1632-1687): Major French composer, who laid the foundation for the French operatic tradition. Lully created a national style that focused on magnificence, tragic drama and dance.
Lully created a national style that focused on magnificence, tragic drama and dance. He designed a type of recitative that was modeled on spoken drama, using one pitch per syllable and reflecting the flexibility of the French language, with its continuous changes of meter. His arias tend to be short and limited in vocal range, with an emphasis on clear enunciation. Machaut, Guillaume de (c. 1300-1377): Important composer of sacred and secular music; master of polyphonic technique and musical eloquence. Mahler, Gustav (1860-1911): Great Austrian composer and opera conductor of the late romantic era. Although he never wrote an opera, Mahler was a master of smaller-scale vocal music and his orchestral music has deep affinities with vocal music in its expressive content.
Metastasio, Pietro (1698-1782): Greatest librettist of the first half of the 18th century. Metastasio standardized his libretti into a formulaic dramatic procedure and formularized arias into a structure known as the “da capo” aria. His reforms influenced the development of opera seria. Meyerbeer, Giacomo (1791-1864): German-born composer who almost single-handedly established French grand opera. Meyerbeer was famous for his ability to manage enormous forces on stage. His most famous opera is Les Huguenots of 1836. His operas have fallen into obscurity because they lack musical and dramatic substance. 258 Biographical Notes Monteverdi, Claudio (1567-1643): Italian composer credited with the creation of the first opera, Orfeo of 1607.
Monteverdi did not invent opera, but elevated it to a level of artistic viability and substance it had not previously enjoyed. His most important contribution to the genre was an elevated form of recitative: arioso. He was the first composer to use purely instrumental passages in ensemble numbers in opera. He was in advance of his time in his use of dissonance and chromatic harmonies and in his ability to express fundamental emotions through music. Many of his operas are still performed today. Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus (1756-1791): Great Austrian composer of the classical era. His operas are widely regarded as his greatest contribution to musical history. A major aspect of Mozart’s significance as an opera composer is his unprecedented genius for musical characterization and dramatic momentum.
A major aspect of Mozart’s significance as an opera composer is his unprecedented genius for musical characterization and dramatic momentum. He is a consummate master of complex and subtle vocal and orchestral manipulation. Mozart’s music does not just decorate the libretto. It creates a whole new drama, revealing subtleties and truths that go beyond the libretto. It energizes the dramatic action and fleshes out his characters, imbuing them with an extraordinary range of moods, emotions, subtlety, unconscious motivation and humanity. Mussorgsky, Modest (1839-1881): Great Russian composer and member of the so-called Russian Five, a group of composers who established the Russian national style of the mid to late 19th century. His opera Boris Godunov is the pinnacle of Russian opera.
His opera Boris Godunov is the pinnacle of Russian opera. Pergolesi, Giovanni (1710-1736): Italian composer of La serva padrona (1733), the first important opera buffa that laid the foundation for subsequent contributions to the genre. Peri, Jacopo (1561-1633): One of the earliest Italian opera composers and member of the Florentine Camerata. Peri is known for his operas Daphne and Euridice. Puccini, Giacomo (1858-1924): Great Italian composer of universally popular operas. Puccini was the greatest exponent of the opera verismo style, which found inspiration in the dark side of human nature. He was a superb 259 lyricist and consummate dramatist.
He was a superb 259 lyricist and consummate dramatist. Among his best-loved and renowned operas are Madam Butterfly, Tosca and La Bohème. Rameau, Jean-Philippe (1683-1764): Foremost French composer of the 18th century. Rameau’s operas display much less contrast between aria and recitative than contemporary Italian operas. Although Rameau’s operas are rarely heard outside France because they are tailored to particular French tastes, they are worth seeking out for their musical value. Rinuccini, Ottavio (1562-1621): Italian poet/librettist and member of the Florentine Camerata. Rinuccini wrote the libretti for the earliest operas: Caccini’s Euridice and Peri’s Daphne.
Rinuccini wrote the libretti for the earliest operas: Caccini’s Euridice and Peri’s Daphne. Rossini, Gioacchino (1792-1868): Greatest Italian composer of the bel canto style. Rossini had a great gift for wit, comedy and compositional innovation. He pioneered the use of strings instead of harpsichord or piano to accompany recitative. He invented the long, orchestral type of crescendo known as the “Rossini crescendo.” He was a master of orchestral color and musical characterization. His opera, The Barber of Seville remains one of the best-loved and greatest comic operas of all time. Its most famous aria, “Largo al factotum,” introduces the character of Figaro and is a brilliant example of musical characterization.
Its most famous aria, “Largo al factotum,” introduces the character of Figaro and is a brilliant example of musical characterization. Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1712-1778): Swiss-born French philosopher and composer who embraced the Italian opera buffa genre as an example of opera appropriate to the Enlightenment. His Le Devin du village (1752) is very close to the popular French tradition of opéra comique. Scarlatti, Alessandro (1660-1725): Founder of the Neapolitan school of opera, Scarlatti’s operas exerted substantial influence on other opera composers. Strauss, Richard (1864-1949): Brilliant German composer, whose music stretches Wagnerian concepts to further limits. Strauss’s psychopathological and erotic masterpiece Salome represents experimental, post-Victorian trends at the turn of the 20th century.
Strauss’s psychopathological and erotic masterpiece Salome represents experimental, post-Victorian trends at the turn of the 20th century. 260 Biographical Notes Verdi, Giuseppe (1813-1901): Greatest Italian opera composer of the second half of the 19th century. Verdi’s operas endure because of their use of well-written libretti, their melodic beauty, their focus on human emotions, their psychological insight, and their unsurpassed dramatic power. Among Verdi’s greatest operas are Rigoletto, La Traviata and Otello. Wagner, Richard (1813-1883): Great German composer whose operas revolutionized music and whose opera, Tristan and Isolde is considered, along with Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, the most influential composition of the 19th century.
Wagner developed the concept of the music drama (Gesamtkunstwerk) as an artistic genre that encompasses all types of art: drama, music, poetry, dance, etc. He created the leitmotif whereby musical motives are assigned to characters, things or concepts and he gave the orchestra unprecedented power as the purveyor of inner meanings and unspoken truths. Weber, Carl Maria von (1786-1826): German composer whose opera Der Freischütz became the definitive work that established 19th-century German opera, characterized by the use of spoken dialogue, and plots that hinge on the supernatural as found in German medieval legend. Weelkes, Thomas (c. 1575-1623): One of the great English madrigal composers. Weelkes was a master of word painting. 261 Bibliography General Sources Donington, Robert.
