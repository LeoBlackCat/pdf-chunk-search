■ Course Scope 3 Litigation and Legal Practice I n this series of 12 lectures, you will explore the important roles that litigation and the adversarial system play in American law. The course begins with an examination of the American legal system generally, including the significance of law and lawyers in our history and society. You will then consider what it means to think like a lawyer, learning about matters of precedent, textual analysis, inductive and deductive logic, logical fallacies, and the use of analogy. You will also examine the practical and ethical issues of the attorney-client relationship, learning why a lawyer might want to represent a seemingly guilty person, for example, and what a lawyer should do if a client asks her to break the law.
As the course continues, you will learn about pretrial preparation, jury selection, opening statements, direct examination, cross-examination, and closing arguments. You will consider how media coverage and social media can impact what happens in the courtroom. You will learn about evidence-what types of evidence might be introduced at trial, how to handle common objections, and how to address the problems caused by false confessions, mistaken eyewitness identification, and flawed expert testimony. As you approach the end of the course, you will begin to examine the appeals process, including the various procedures, standards of review, and approaches to effective advocacy that distinguish appellate courts from trial courts.
Finally, the course concludes with an exploration of the United States Supreme Court-its history, its function, and the unique challenges and opportunities that it presents for lawyers, clients, and the American people as a whole. ■ Lecture 1 LITIGATION AND THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM L itigation holds a special role in the American legal system, and learning about it offers a valuable orientation to the study of law generally. In this lecture, you will explore why we adopted the particular legal system we have in this country, how that system works, and why law is taught in America the way it is. 6 Litigation and Legal Practice LAW IN AMERICAN SOCIETY z z America is a nation of laws.
6 Litigation and Legal Practice LAW IN AMERICAN SOCIETY z z America is a nation of laws. From the very beginning, America has grappled with the question of how much power the government should have over the people, and the rules under which people interact with one another. When America broke away from England in 1776, it famously rejected the notion that a king gets to make those rules. Instead, the power of the government and of lawmaking belongs to the people. z z When our country was founded, the Founding Fathers were, in essence, breaking the law. By rebelling against the British monarchy, they were, in the eyes of England, committing treason.
By rebelling against the British monarchy, they were, in the eyes of England, committing treason. To make the case that breaking away from England was the right thing to do, the Founding Fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, proclaiming that “governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” 7 Lecture 1- Litigation and the American Legal System z z The notion that the people are in charge was an extraordinary idea at the time our country was founded. Given the number of authoritarian governments that continue to exist in other parts of the world, it’s still remarkable today. z z After gaining independence, the Founding Fathers began replacing the legal system they were rejecting with a new one. In 1787, they drafted the U.S.
In 1787, they drafted the U.S. Constitution, which limited the power of the federal government and established a system in which the people could undo everything if they wanted to. z z America has continued to be a nation where people question the laws, challenge them, change them, and rely on them. Our nation is composed of people who quite often do not agree with one another. Every election cycle, we take some people out of power and put new people in charge. Regular citizens are able to be involved with the law, to influence the shape of the law, simply by voting or raising a claim in court. z z Because of the importance of law to the functioning for our country, lawyers have long played a prominent role in American society. More than half of the 45 U.S. Presidents have been lawyers.
