music subservient to words and how, because of its forward-driving nature, recitative cannot express personal reflection. We learn how the invention of aria gave opera composers a powerful tool to stop the dramatic action for moments of self-reflection. Gluck’s reforms and his Orfeo ed Euridice of 1762 are addressed as the starting point for the modern opera repertory. The explosion of operas in the Golden Age/Dark Age of opera is discussed, along with the formulaic reforms of Pietro Metastasio (including his da capo structure for arias) and the vocal abuses that those reforms provoked. We learn how different voice types are assigned different roles. The rise of opera seria and its characteristics are discussed, along with an analysis of the
opera seria and its characteristics are discussed, along with an analysis of the second act of Mozart’s Idomeneo-opera seria transcendent. The second part of this study continues with the development of opera buffa, from its origins in the popular folklore of the commedia dell’arte to its eventual replacement of opera seria. The role of Enlightenment progressives in this development is addressed and Mozart’s brilliant The Marriage of Figaro is discussed as one of the greatest contributions to the opera buffa genre. Part III opens with a discussion of the bel canto style of opera. We see how the nature of the Italian language and culture gave rise to this type of opera, with its comic, predictable plots, one-dimensional characters, appealing melodies,
its comic, predictable plots, one-dimensional characters, appealing melodies, and florid melodic embellishments. The highly pressurized business of opera in the 18th century is revealed, and we are introduced to Rossini’s The Barber of Seville of 1816 as the quintessential bel canto opera. 3 Giuseppe Verdi is the focus of Lectures 19 through 22 of Part III. His career is summarized, and his operatic inheritance is reviewed. We learn how Verdi broke the bel canto mold; how he dominated Italian opera for over half a century by virtue of his lyricism, his emphasis on human emotions and psychological insight, and his use of the orchestra and parlante to drive the dramatic action and maintain musical continuity. Verdi’s Otello is discussed
dramatic action and maintain musical continuity. Verdi’s Otello is discussed as one of the greatest operas of all time. Part III of this course concludes with an examination of French opera. We learn how it developed as a distinctly different genre from Italian opera, shaped as it was by the French language, culture and political history. We learn how Jean-Baptiste Lully set the foundation for a French language operatic tradition, and how his greatest contribution was the design of a recitative style suited to the French language. The reforms of JeanPhilippe Rameau are discussed, along with the influence of Enlightenment progressives such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who championed a more natural operatic style. Christoph Willibald von Gluck’s position as the model
natural operatic style. Christoph Willibald von Gluck’s position as the model for the next generation of French composers is reviewed. Finally, the subject of 19th-century French opera is addressed. Grand opera, opéra comique and lyric opera are examined as distinctive French genres and Act Two of Bizet’s dramatically powerful Carmen is analyzed. Part IV opens with an examination of the rise of German opera, with its roots in German folklore. We discover how German singspiel grew from humble origins as a lower class entertainment to high art with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s The Rescue from the Harem (1782) and The Magic Flute of 1791. We learn how 19th-century German opera grew out of the tradition of singspiel and how Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz established
of singspiel and how Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz established 19th-century German opera. The discussion of German opera continues with an examination of Richard Wagner: the man, his personal beliefs, musical theories, and operatic innovations. We see how Wagner went back to the ancient Greek ideal for inspiration and how he conceived the idea of an all-encompassing art work, or music drama, in which the role of the orchestra is that of a purveyor of unspoken truths. We are introduced to Wagner’s concept of leitmotif and his revolutionary use of dissonance. Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde is discussed as Scope 4 the most influential composition of the 19th century, aside from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.
Scope 4 the most influential composition of the 19th century, aside from Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. The subject of late romantic German opera is addressed and exemplified by Richard Strauss and his controversial opera Salome. We go on to an overview of Russian opera and the concept of nationalism. The late development of Russian opera is outlined from Mikhail Glinka’s Ruslan and Lyudmila to Modest Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov. We see how the Russian language shaped the syllabic vocal style of Russian opera and how Russian rhythms, with their asymmetrical groupings of accents, are distinct from Italian, German and French rhythms. The course draws to its conclusion with an overview of opera verismo, a
German and French rhythms. The course draws to its conclusion with an overview of opera verismo, a 19th/20th century genre that favors depictions of the darker side of the human condition. The pivotal second act of Giacomo Puccini’s Tosca is discussed as a transcendent example of opera verismo. Finally, we hear part of a scene from Richard Strauss’s Capriccio in which the essence of opera is debated. Is it words or is it music? It is neither. It is an indefinable combination of both, with the whole greater than the parts. ■ 5 Introduction and Words and Music Lectures 1 and 2 Lectures 1 through 4 [of this course] are conceived of as a large introductory set, consisting of three separate parts....

W e will begin our consideration of opera by examining Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot (1924). The scene is set in the city of Beijing in ancient China. Turandot, the daughter of the Chinese emperor, has promised to marry the man who can solve three riddles. So far no one has succeeded in answering these riddles. Calaf, the young Tartar prince, falls in love at first sight with Turandot and promptly announces his challenge to
love at first sight with Turandot and promptly announces his challenge to the riddles. He solves the riddles and then volunteers that if Turandot can discover his name before dawn, she will be freed from her vow to marry him and he will die. Turandot commands that no one shall sleep until the stranger’s name and identity are discovered. Calaf sings a magnificent aria reflecting his love for Turandot and his confidence that his identity will remain a secret until morning. His aria, which begins with the phrase “Nessun dorma” (“No one shall sleep”), is one of opera’s most dramatic and emotionally powerful moments. Puccini could have set Calaf’s aria in a variety of different ways. For dramatic reasons, he chose to set it as a love song. It is significant for its sense of joy
