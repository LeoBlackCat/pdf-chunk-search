examination, cross-examination, and closing arguments. You will consider how media coverage and social media can impact what happens in the courtroom. You will learn about evidence-what types of evidence might be introduced at trial, how to handle common objections, and how to address the problems caused by false confessions, mistaken eyewitness identification, and flawed expert testimony. As you approach the end of the course, you will begin to examine the appeals process, including the various procedures, standards of review, and approaches to effective advocacy that distinguish appellate courts from trial courts.

Finally, the course concludes with an exploration of the United States Supreme Court-its history, its function, and the unique challenges and opportunities that it presents for lawyers, clients, and the American people as a whole. ■ Lecture 1 LITIGATION AND THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM L itigation holds a special role in the American legal system, and learning about it offers a valuable orientation to the study of law generally. In this lecture, you will explore why we adopted the particular legal system we have in this country, how that system works, and why law is taught in America the way it is.
how that system works, and why law is taught in America the way it is. 6 Litigation and Legal Practice LAW IN AMERICAN SOCIETY z z America is a nation of laws. From the very beginning, America has grappled with the question of how much power the government should have over the people, and the rules under which people interact with one another. When America broke away from England in 1776, it famously rejected the notion that a king gets to make those rules. Instead, the power of the government and of lawmaking belongs to the people. z z When our country was founded, the Founding Fathers were, in essence, breaking the law. By rebelling against the British monarchy, they were, in the eyes of England, committing treason.
in essence, breaking the law. By rebelling against the British monarchy, they were, in the eyes of England, committing treason. To make the case that breaking away from England was the right thing to do, the Founding Fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, proclaiming that “governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” 7 Lecture 1- Litigation and the American Legal System z z The notion that the people are in charge was an extraordinary idea at the time our country was founded. Given the number of authoritarian governments that continue to exist in other parts of the world, it’s still remarkable today. z z After gaining independence, the Founding Fathers began replacing the legal system they were rejecting with a new one.
z z After gaining independence, the Founding Fathers began replacing the legal system they were rejecting with a new one. In 1787, they drafted the U.S. Constitution, which limited the power of the federal government and established a system in which the people could undo everything if they wanted to. z z America has continued to be a nation where people question the laws, challenge them, change them, and rely on them. Our nation is composed of people who quite often do not agree with one another. Every election cycle, we take some people out of power and put new people in charge. Regular citizens are able to be involved with the law, to influence the shape of the law, simply by voting or raising a claim in court.
in charge. Regular citizens are able to be involved with the law, to influence the shape of the law, simply by voting or raising a claim in court. z z Because of the importance of law to the functioning for our country, lawyers have long played a prominent role in American society. More than half of the 45 U.S. Presidents have been lawyers. So are many members of Congress, most judges, and many prominent leaders in business and banking. z z You will certainly see lawyers at work if you go to a courtroom. But lawyers are also often the people who lead large corporations or help them do business or merge with one another. Lawyers also frequently run our various administrative agencies, which govern things like taxes, the environment, the Internet, elections, and the financial markets.
which govern things like taxes, the environment, the Internet, elections, and the financial markets. 8 Litigation and Legal Practice STRUCTURAL DISTINCTIONS z z The American legal system is a common law system, and is derived from English legal tradition. Some countries, like France, Italy, and others in continental Europe, have a civil law system. In a civil law system, written-down rules-often called codes-are the primary basis of the law. Judges in these systems interpret the code and make sure it is followed, but their decisions have no lasting authority. z z In our common law system, by contrast, written-down laws-we call them statutes-and judicial decisions are both important sources of law.
z z In our common law system, by contrast, written-down laws-we call them statutes-and judicial decisions are both important sources of law. What a judge says about the law can be every bit as important as a statute, and sometimes more so. Yet our judges are also bound by statutes and by the decisions of other judges who have come before them. z z A common law system checks the power of the legislature, which creates a statute, because a judge gets to interpret it. It also limits a judge’s power, however, because he has to follow the rulings of previous judges. He can’t just make up an outcome according to his own personal desires. z z America’s legal system is also an adversarial system.
of previous judges. He can’t just make up an outcome according to his own personal desires. z z America’s legal system is also an adversarial system. In an adversarial system, parties make their best arguments before a judge or jury, and from the conflict between them, the judge or jury determines the truth of what happened. This is different from the inquisitorial system used in some civil law countries. In an inquisitorial system, the judge acts as an investigator in a case, questioning witnesses and suspects. LEVELS OF REVIEW z z Trial courts are the courts where cases start. At trial, both sides present evidence to demonstrate what happened in the dispute that brought them to court.
At trial, both sides present evidence to demonstrate what happened in the dispute that brought them to court. There is a judge who decides what evidence can be considered and whether the procedural rules are being followed. A trial can be decided either by a judge or a jury, depending on the type of case. 9 Lecture 1- Litigation and the American Legal System z z Many jurisdictions have trial-level courts that hear a wide variety of cases. These courts are sometimes called general district courts. Some jurisdictions also have specialized trial courts. For example, a court system might have a specialized traffic court, a divorce court, or a court for juveniles. z z Legal cases are divided into two broad categories: civil and criminal. Civil cases involve disputes between private parties.
