To make the case that breaking away from England was the right thing to do, the Founding Fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, proclaiming that “governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” 7 Lecture 1- Litigation and the American Legal System z z The notion that the people are in charge was an extraordinary idea at the time our country was founded. Given the number of authoritarian governments that continue to exist in other parts of the world, it’s still remarkable today. z z After gaining independence, the Founding Fathers began replacing the legal system they were rejecting with a new one. In 1787, they drafted the U.S.
Constitution, which limited the power of the federal government and established a system in which the people could undo everything if they wanted to. z z America has continued to be a nation where people question the laws, challenge them, change them, and rely on them. Our nation is composed of people who quite often do not agree with one another. Every election cycle, we take some people out of power and put new people in charge. Regular citizens are able to be involved with the law, to influence the shape of the law, simply by voting or raising a claim in court. z z Because of the importance of law to the functioning for our country, lawyers have long played a prominent role in American society. More than half of the 45 U.S. Presidents have been lawyers.
So are many members of Congress, most judges, and many prominent leaders in business and banking. z z You will certainly see lawyers at work if you go to a courtroom. But lawyers are also often the people who lead large corporations or help them do business or merge with one another. Lawyers also frequently run our various administrative agencies, which govern things like taxes, the environment, the Internet, elections, and the financial markets. 8 Litigation and Legal Practice STRUCTURAL DISTINCTIONS z z The American legal system is a common law system, and is derived from English legal tradition. Some countries, like France, Italy, and others in continental Europe, have a civil law system. In a civil law system, written-down rules-often called codes-are the primary basis of the law.
Judges in these systems interpret the code and make sure it is followed, but their decisions have no lasting authority. z z In our common law system, by contrast, written-down laws-we call them statutes-and judicial decisions are both important sources of law. What a judge says about the law can be every bit as important as a statute, and sometimes more so. Yet our judges are also bound by statutes and by the decisions of other judges who have come before them. z z A common law system checks the power of the legislature, which creates a statute, because a judge gets to interpret it. It also limits a judge’s power, however, because he has to follow the rulings of previous judges. He can’t just make up an outcome according to his own personal desires.
z z America’s legal system is also an adversarial system. In an adversarial system, parties make their best arguments before a judge or jury, and from the conflict between them, the judge or jury determines the truth of what happened. This is different from the inquisitorial system used in some civil law countries. In an inquisitorial system, the judge acts as an investigator in a case, questioning witnesses and suspects. LEVELS OF REVIEW z z Trial courts are the courts where cases start. At trial, both sides present evidence to demonstrate what happened in the dispute that brought them to court. There is a judge who decides what evidence can be considered and whether the procedural rules are being followed. A trial can be decided either by a judge or a jury, depending on the type of case.
9 Lecture 1- Litigation and the American Legal System z z Many jurisdictions have trial-level courts that hear a wide variety of cases. These courts are sometimes called general district courts. Some jurisdictions also have specialized trial courts. For example, a court system might have a specialized traffic court, a divorce court, or a court for juveniles. z z Legal cases are divided into two broad categories: civil and criminal. Civil cases involve disputes between private parties. The person who brings a civil lawsuit is called the plaintiff, and the person who is sued is called the defendant. z z In a criminal case, a person is accused of breaking a criminal law.
In criminal cases, the person against whom the suit is brought is still called the defendant, but the person bringing the suit is a prosecutor representing either the state or federal government. 10 Litigation and Legal Practice z z If a party believes that something has been wrongly decided at trial, he or she may be able to appeal that issue to an appellate court. The issue has to be preserved for appeal, however, which usually means that the attorney has to flag the perceived problem during the trial by objecting and indicating the nature of the error. In addition, the appeal typically has to be filed within a certain time period. z z In an appellate court, there are no witnesses and no jury, and the parties do not present evidence.
Instead, lawyers argue legal issues to group of judges, often referred to as a panel. Appellate courts do not rehear all the facts of a case; instead, they focus on the specific question of law being appealed to determine whether that question was decided correctly. z z If the trial court has made an error, the appellate court may overrule the trial court’s decision and issue a written opinion about it. If a party disagrees with an appellate court decision, it may appeal to the ultimate judicial tribunal of a court system, which is often referred to as the jurisdiction’s supreme court. That court may overrule or affirm the appellate court’s decision and issue a written opinion of its own.
FEDERALISM AND PREEMPTION z z America has both federal and state laws, and the two are not always consistent with one another. What might be legal in one state might not be legal in another, and state laws and federal laws also clash on occasion. Because we have a dual system of laws, we also have a dual system of courts-federal and state. z z This system again has its roots in the American Revolution. The framers of our Constitution wanted to limit the power of our federal government. So our Constitution gives certain powers to the federal government, but leaves other powers to the states, and it does not require the states to have laws identical to one another.
11 Lecture 1- Litigation and the American Legal System z z Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, which means they can only hear certain kinds of cases. They can hear cases that raise a federal question, which means the plaintiff or prosecutor has alleged a violation of the U.S. Constitution, a federal law, or a treaty. They can also hear cases involving disputes between parties from different states. z z In addition to state and federal statutes, and the case law written by judges, laws also comes from constitutions (both federal and state), from treaties, and from regulations. Regulations are rules made by an agency at either the state or federal level pursuant to a statute. z z The U.S.
