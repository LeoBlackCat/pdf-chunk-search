It does not provide a comprehensive overview of the entire operatic repertory. Armed with the knowledge of opera gained from this course, the listener will be able to explore the extraordinary and compelling world of opera. The listener will appreciate how music reveals truths beyond the spoken word; how opera is a unique marriage of words and music in which the whole is far greater than its parts.
The course traces the history of opera from its beginning in the early seventeenth century to around 1924, referencing landmark operas, musical, cultural, and social developments, and historical events that influenced opera’s growth. It examines how operatic style and form have changed continuously throughout the history of European music, influenced by political, social, and cultural developments, and how different national languages and cultures have shaped their own types of opera and operatic style. The course opens with the aria “Nessun dorma” from Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot, showcasing opera’s unique incorporation of soliloquy, dialogue, scenery, action, and continuous music into an expressive whole.
This famous aria illustrates the power of the composer in creating music that evokes unspoken thoughts and feelings. The study continues with a discussion of how music can flesh out a dramatic character and evoke the unconscious state. Operatic archetypes such as Figaro and Carmen are introduced. The ancient Greeks revered music as a microcosm of all creation, believing it could change the face of nature and alter souls. The course examines the monophonic and polyphonic music of the Middle Ages, the rise of secular and instrumental music, the Renaissance, and the evolution of early opera. Part I concludes with an analysis of Monteverdi’s Orfeo of 1607, the first successful attempt to combine words and music into musical drama.
In Part II, the essence of Monteverdi’s style is explored through recitative, which made music subservient to words. The invention of aria is discussed as a powerful tool for self-reflection. Gluck’s reforms and his Orfeo ed Euridice of 1762 are addressed as the starting point for the modern opera repertory. The course continues with the development of opera buffa, Mozart’s contributions, and the bel canto style of opera. The focus shifts to Giuseppe Verdi, his operatic inheritance, and his innovations that broke the bel canto mold. Part III concludes with an examination of French opera, its distinct characteristics, and the influence of composers like Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau.
Part IV opens with the rise of German opera, its roots in folklore, and the contributions of Richard Wagner, who sought to create an all-encompassing art form. The course examines late romantic German opera, Russian opera, and the concept of nationalism. The course draws to its conclusion with an overview of opera verismo, exemplified by Puccini’s Tosca, and a discussion of Richard Strauss’s Capriccio, which debates the essence of opera as a combination of words and music. **Introduction and Words and Music** **Lectures 1 and 2** Lectures 1 through 4 serve as an introductory set, consisting of three parts: a general introduction to opera, a presentation called “Words and Music,” and a brief history of vocal expression in music.
We begin by examining Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot (1924), set in ancient Beijing. Turandot, the daughter of the Chinese emperor, promises to marry the man who can solve three riddles. Calaf, a young Tartar prince, falls in love with Turandot and challenges her riddles. He solves them and offers that if she discovers his name before dawn, she will be freed from her vow to marry him. Calaf sings a magnificent aria, “Nessun dorma,” reflecting his love and confidence. Puccini could have set Calaf’s aria in various ways, but he chose a love song for its sense of joy and redemption. This feeling prompts us to examine the nature of opera. An opera is a drama that combines soliloquy, dialogue, scenery, action, and continuous music, creating a whole greater than its parts.
The operatic repertory is diverse, having evolved from aristocratic to popular entertainment over its four-hundred-year history. The popularity of opera is attributed to music’s power to distill and intensify the meaning of words. Children at play exemplify the operatic ideal, as music evokes ineffable moods and states of consciousness. In opera, the composer acts as a dramatist, using music to create character. Examples include Mozart’s chilling portrayal of Electra’s fury in “Of Orestes and Ajax” and Mahler’s bittersweet expression of lost love in “As I Walked through the Field this Morning.” These arias exemplify the enduring popularity of opera, where the beauty of vocal music and the excitement of theater create an irresistible force.
The combination of self-reflective words and emotionally reflective music packs a powerful appeal. This course has several goals: to outline the history of opera from 1600 to 1924, observe the development of national schools of opera, develop a methodology for listening to and understanding opera, and celebrate the power of words joined to music. **A Brief History of Vocal Expression in Music** **Lectures 3 and 4** In Lectures 3 and 4, we encounter a brief history of vocal expression in Western music, paving the way toward the invention of opera. The phrase “music as a mirror” suggests that stylistic changes in music reflect the realities of the society in which composers live.
Western music has exhibited ongoing stylistic change since the High Middle Ages, with composers seeking to express themselves and their world through music. We begin by considering the role of music in ancient Greece, where music was believed to be a microcosm of all creation. Ancient Greek drama was sung with accompaniment, and only about forty fragments of ancient music have survived. An example of music in ancient Greek drama is the Stasimon Chorus from Orestes, which features a single voice accompanied by a double reed instrument. The Greek view of music was humanistic, believing it could change nature and alter souls. The Middle Ages (600-1400) saw the Church dominate music and culture.
The first part of the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, produced monophonic vocal music, such as Gregorian chant. The High Middle Ages saw the rise of polyphony and the development of a new class of professional performers. Secular music grew as royal courts and the aristocracy flourished, leading to the creation of troubadour music. The 14th century marked the end of the Church’s absolute authority, leading to a new world of secularism and humanistic pursuit. The Renaissance (1400-1600) saw a rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman culture, with composers seeking to have the same impact on listeners as the Greeks. By the mid-Renaissance, a new view of vocal articulation and harmony emerged, accommodating more expressive aims.
Josquin des Prez exemplified mid-Renaissance music, with works like “El Grillo” showcasing homophony and word painting. The late Renaissance saw the rise of the madrigal, a work for four to six singers that mixed homophony and polyphony. **The Invention of Opera and Monteverdi’s Orfeo** **Lectures 5-8** The intermezzo was vital as a forerunner of opera, keeping alive the idea of collaboration between drama and music. We review the Greek ideal of music, the Renaissance’s growing awareness of it, and the madrigal as an experimental genre. Carlo Gesualdo’s madrigal “Io parto e non piu dissi” exemplifies harmonic complexity and emotional expression. We consider the intermezzo, presented between acts of spoken plays, which became more interesting than the plays themselves.
The pastorale, a style of dramatic poetry, dominated Italian theater in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The Florentine Camerata, a private academy, sought to achieve true musical expression through a single singer employing dramatic skills. Their theory led to the creation of the first operas, including Peri’s Euridice. Claudio Monteverdi, the first great composer of opera, created Orfeo, which synthesizes musical genres and techniques of the time. The character of Orpheus symbolizes the power of music. In Act 1 of Orfeo, happiness prevails as Eurydice agrees to marry Orpheus. Monteverdi’s style of recitative, known as arioso, is closer to song than Peri’s. The act concludes with a celebratory chorus. Act 2 introduces grief as Orpheus learns of Eurydice’s death.
The messenger’s story builds to a powerful climax, and Orpheus’s response is profoundly moving. Act 3 involves Orpheus’s journey to Hades, where he encounters Charon, the boatman. Orpheus’s plea is the opera’s crown jewel, showcasing the power of music. In Act 4, Pluto presents a challenge, and Orpheus’s disobedience leads to Eurydice’s return to Hades. Act 5 concludes with Orpheus’s despair and Apollo’s intervention. Monteverdi’s Orfeo succeeds on every level, synthesizing genres and embodying the power of recitative. It redefines the Greek ideal of music’s power to calm troubled hearts. **The Growth of Opera, the Development of Italian Opera Seria, and Mozart’s Idomeneo** **Lectures 9-12** The earliest operas were a synthesis of old and new musical and dramatic genres.
We begin by reviewing the birth of opera and the invention of the aria. Early operas inherited elements from the Renaissance, including stage scenery, dance episodes, popular songs, and madrigal-style choruses. Recitative was the essence of Monteverdi’s operatic art, used for action, narrative, and dialogue. The concept of aria, where music creates an expressive world, had not yet been realized. We consider Gluck’s operas as the starting point for the modern opera repertory. The first phase of the golden/dark age of opera saw the opening of public opera houses and the rapid development of opera as a public entertainment. The second phase, characterized by reformers like Pietro Metastasio, standardized operatic structure and emphasized vocal virtuosity.
Arias became classified into standard types, and singers increasingly embellished their performances. We discuss voice types, including soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, and their characteristics. Gluck’s operas distinguished themselves through dramatic viability and a focus on storytelling. Mozart’s Idomeneo is the greatest opera seria, transcending the formulas of the genre. Idomeneo’s seamless music takes it out of the category of traditional opera seria, showcasing Mozart’s innovative approach. **The Rise of Opera Buffa and Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro** **Lectures 13-16** Comic opera developed separately from opera seria, rooted in popular entertainment. Opera buffa grew out of the Enlightenment, emphasizing accessible melodies and everyday situations.
We compare Vivaldi’s “Siam navi all’onde algenti” with Mozart’s “Non più andrai” to illustrate the differences in style. Mozart’s collaborations with librettist Lorenzo da Ponte produced masterpieces like The Marriage of Figaro. The Marriage of Figaro’s story, adapted from Beaumarchais’ plays, critiques the French aristocracy. We explore the characters and musical examples that convey their identities. The Act 2 finale is a remarkable continuous sequence of ensembles, showcasing Mozart’s dramatic craft. **The Bel Canto Style and Rossini’s The Barber of Seville** **Lectures 17 and 18** By the early 19th century, Italian opera became a conventional commercial enterprise, focusing on opera buffa. The bel canto style favored directness and simplicity, with composers like Rossini leading the way.
Rossini’s The Barber of Seville exemplifies the bel canto style, with a focus on character archetypes and comedic elements. We examine the characters and musical examples that convey their identities. The music lesson scene showcases Rossini’s comedic craft. **Verdi and Otello** **Lectures 19-22** Giuseppe Verdi’s career constitutes the history of Italian opera from 1850 to 1900. Verdi’s operas evolved toward refinement and intensification of dramatic content. His operas broke the mold of bel canto, emphasizing musical continuity and the role of the orchestra. Otello, based on Shakespeare’s play, exemplifies Verdi’s mature style and dramatic depth. **French Opera** **Lectures 23 and 24** French opera developed later than Italian opera, influenced by the French language and spirit.
Jean-Baptiste Lully established a French operatic tradition, incorporating elements of ballet and dramatic literature. Lully’s operas emphasized grandeur and tragic drama, while Jean-Philippe Rameau’s works introduced new musical ideas. **German Opera Comes of Age** **Lecture 25** German opera emerged with Mozart’s The Magic Flute in 1791, influenced by the German language and culture. Singspiel, a partly sung, partly spoken genre, laid the groundwork for German opera. Carl Maria von Weber’s Der Freischütz established 19th-century German opera, characterized by supernatural themes. **Richard Wagner and Tristan und Isolde** **Lectures 26 and 27** Richard Wagner was a controversial figure whose operas revolutionized music.
Wagner’s theories were influenced by Schopenhauer’s philosophy, leading to the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk. Tristan und Isolde exemplifies Wagner’s mature style, exploring themes of love and death through leitmotifs. **Late Romantic German Opera-Richard Strauss and Salome** **Lecture 28** Richard Strauss, hailed as Wagner’s successor, composed operas like Salome, which challenged societal norms. Salome’s story, based on Oscar Wilde’s play, explores themes of desire and power. **Russian Opera** **Lectures 29 and 30** Russian musical nationalism emerged in the 19th century, influenced by the rise of nationalism in Europe. The Five, a group of composers, sought to create a uniquely Russian musical tradition.
Mikhail Glinka’s operas laid the foundation for Russian opera, while Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov exemplifies the pinnacle of Russian opera. **Verismo, Puccini, and Tosca** **Lectures 31 and 32** Giacomo Puccini was the greatest composer of verismo opera, with works like Tosca exploring emotional extremes. Tosca’s story, based on historical events, showcases Puccini’s ability to blend words and music for dramatic effect. The course concludes with a discussion of Richard Strauss’s Capriccio, emphasizing the relationship between words and music in opera. **Timeline** c. 1440 - Josquin des Prez born (d. 1521). c. 1546 - Giulio Caccini born (d. 1618). 1561 - Jacopo Peri born (d. c.1633). 1562 - Ottavio Rinuccini born (d.1621). 1567 - Claudio Monteverdi born (d. 1643).
